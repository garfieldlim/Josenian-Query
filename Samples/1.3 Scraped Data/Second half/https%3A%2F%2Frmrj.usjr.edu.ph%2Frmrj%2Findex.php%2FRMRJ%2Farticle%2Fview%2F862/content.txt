Abstract
This study examined the religiosity and spiritual well-being of Catholic senior high school students of a rural Catholic school. Using the descriptive-comparative and correlational research design, data collection involved the survey questionnaires and hypotheses-testing used the Mann Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis, and Pearson r. In general, the students demonstrated a very high extent of religiosity, but they significantly differ when compared by grade level, church involvement, mass attendance, and Catholic identity. They had moderate spiritual well-being, but a significant difference was noted between males and females. Nevertheless, a significant relationship exists between religiosity and spiritual wellbeing, which suggests that the more the students observe Catholic teachings and practices, the more they mature in God's personal experience and achieve a sense of satisfaction and purpose in life. This study provides baseline data for developing the religious education curriculum and enhancing the campus ministry programs and activities of the said school.
