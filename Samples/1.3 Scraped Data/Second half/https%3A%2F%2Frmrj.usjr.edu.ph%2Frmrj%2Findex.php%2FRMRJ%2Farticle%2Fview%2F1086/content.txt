Abstract
Science research culture in basic education can be associated with science investigatory projects (SIPs). In relation to this, the paper establishes a theory on the development of SIP culture in basic education utilizing theory generation through axiomatic deductive approach based on steps prescribed by R. Padua (personal communication, November 17, 2014) which creates the theory that basic education institutions contribute to high productivity in SIPs. Simply because humans and non-human resources along with quality Science instruction are needed to yield such productivity. These attributes, resources, and Science instruction foster SIP culture. These are crucial aspects as schools capacitate students and teachers, produce the SIPs, and eventually disseminate these projects in science fairs.
