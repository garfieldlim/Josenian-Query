Vol. 11 No. 1 (2023)
Vol. 10 No. 2 (2022)
Welcome 2023!
The water rabbit in the Chinese culture is associated with intuity and thoughtfulness (shorturl.at/KLOPR).  At first glance, these characteristics may seem far from what a researcher needs, but in hindsight, to work using one’s instinct and to be in “the state of being absorbed in thought” are often necessary for research work.
In RMRJ’s December issue, the authors’ intuition and thoughtfulness, vis a vis the methodological rigor they employed, are showcased.
Under Society and Psychology, the Auditors’ Professional Skepticism and Its Relationship with Their Thinking Styles and The Determinants of Fake News Adaptation during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Social Psychology Approach were explored.
In Math, the readers will be brought to an investigation of Deriving a Formula in Solving Reverse Fibonacci Means.
The Business community will be presented with updating and how these efforts fared in Sugbo Negosyo Program Digital Card Implementation: Technology Acceptance and Satisfaction among Microentrepreneur-Beneficiaries and Digital Finance on Stability among Philippine Banks.
Culture will be unveiled in The Tuba Culture in Leyte, Philippines, and the Symbolic Actions of Cultural Characters in Davao Folk Narratives.
Thank you for being part of the academic discussion in RMRJ.  We look forward to your active contribution in the ongoing conversation.

Vol. 10 No. 1 (2022)
The celebration of the 500 years of Christianity in the Philippines was both a milestone and a challenge.  Like a kilometer post that indicates where we are in our journey and how far we have to go yet, the celebration compels Filipinos to look back and embrace the future ahead.
The 10.1 Issue of the RMRJ will also bring us to a "looking back" of humanity's existence with the article " Timeless Existence and Principle of Creation: Notions Embedded in John 1:1, â€œIn the Beginning Was the Word." The journal also looks into the collective and individual experiences during the pandemic that gave birth to the articles: "Modeling Employee Retention Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic: An Econometric Approach", " Paternal Resilience in Time of Pandemic: A Phenomenological Inquiry on the Experiences of Fathers of Children with Autism" and "Understanding the Suicide Phenomenon from the Perspectives of the Loss Survivors."
The present is the most solid anchor for any "looking back" activity.  Hence, the issue includes concerns like the "Ratooning Response of Lowland Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Var. PSB Rc22 to Production Management Practices" "Construction of Difference Sets from Unions of Cyclotomic Classes of Order N=14", "The Properties of Interlocking Directorates in the Philippines: An Exploratory Analysis," and "An Inquiry into the Problems Concerning Filipino Values and Norms."
Daily activities and processes become the point of reflection and investigation like the articles "The Infusion of Folk Catholicism to Tambal Binisaya as an Indigenous Healing System in Iligan City," "Correlating the Psychological and Spiritual Well-Being of Junior High School Students in Selected Catholic Schools in Central Philippines," "The Yapian Classification of the Vocabulary of the Austronesian Visayan-Cebuano Language," "Development of Science Research Culture in Basic Education: A Theory Generation," "Cognitive Dimension of Learning Using Garden-Based Education towards Sustainability: A Meta-Synthesis," and "The Community of Inquiry Instructional Strategies Impact on Student Satisfaction on Remote Learning."
May this issue of the RMRJ be the readers' companion in their pursuit of answers for further inquiry and deeper reflection.
Adelante!

Vol. 9 No. 2 (2021)
Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards. Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.
SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard
Two years into the pandemic and stories abound establishments closing, companies downsizing, individuals embracing virtual spaces, transactions migrating to online platforms, and more. To quote the philosopher Kierkegaard, â€œLife must be lived forwardâ€, and moving forward means getting up, rebuilding from the remnants of pandemic.  For, after all, the subject of life is living, and to live is to be in the present moment and respond to the realities we experience.
In this issue of the RMRJ, we continue to rise up, rebuild, and further the discussion in the field of Education, with the papers: Feynman Technique as a Heutagogical Learning Strategy for Independent and Remote Learning, Green Chemistry Education among Senior High School Chemistry Teachers: Knowledge, Perceptions, and Level of Integration, and Macro and Micro Context Factors in English Language Learning in Modular Distance Learning.
In Math and Engineering, we shall learn more On the Generators of the Group of Units Modulo a Prime and Its Analytic and Probabilistic Views, Approximate Analytic Solution to the Three Species Lotka â€“ Volterra Differential Equation Model, and Rice Machinery Requirement in La Union, Philippines: A Basis for Prioritizing Deployment.
While in Philosophy and Religion, we will have Visayan Philosophy of Labor: A Reflection from the Notion of Kahimtang and John Paul IIâ€™s Philosophy, and lastly, for Business and Economics, a glimpse into the Challenges and Opportunities in Philippine Tourism amid the COVID-19 Pandemic, Food Safety Compliance, and Challenges of Micro Food Business Operators: Implications to COVID-19 Pandemic, Human Resource Management: Pre-pandemic, Pandemic and Beyond.
We wish you an enjoyable and insightful reading ahead and an advance Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

Vol. 9 No. 1 (2021)
The subject of life is living. Hence, to live means to move forward.  COVID-19 challenged this and brought most businesses deemed as non-essentials, the schools, and activities like traveling to a standstill. It brought. Volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) to humanity. To live, then, the human being has to rise from these challenges and get back to the race called life.
The 9.1 issue of the RMRJ centers on the theme RESILIENCY IN THE NEW NORMAL.  Five articles, namely: "Extended Technology Acceptance Model to Examine the Use of Google Forms â€“ based Lesson Playlist amidst COVID-19 Pandemic", "Remote learning readiness and challenges: Experiences among tertiary state university Management Students," "The Philippine K to 12 Program in Thematic Instruction", "The Market Distortion Effect of State Intervention in Higher Education," and the "Factors Affecting the Teachers' Resiliency Amidst the Covid-19 " explore how resiliency is exhibited in the field of education and how education can be more responsive to the present situation.
Research and development in the field of Engineering and Technology will be essayed in "A computer vision application for measuring deflection in two-dimensional view of reinforced concrete beams," "Performance Evaluation of Rice Hull-Fueled Cabinet Food Dryer," "A Sound-based Machine Learning to Predict Traffic Vehicle Density," "Sequential Pattern Mining of Tourist Spatiotemporal Movement Patterns," and "Utilization of Wastewater from Different Sources as a Potential Sources of Electrical Energy."
In the article," Mortality Analysis of Early COVID-19 Cases in the Philippines Based on Observed Demographic and Clinical Characteristics", the disease that restricted and affected the whole world will be brought to light again to understand it further.
The challenge of moving forward will also be responded to in the Math papers that tackle "Angle Trisection, Bhaskara's Proof, and Pythagorean Theorem" and the 'Uniform Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator of Fractal Dimension."
May you be helped by this June 2021 (9.1) issue of the RMRJ in one way or the other and encourage resiliency in others, too.
Godspeed and Adelante!

Before moving forward, I would like to have this opportunity to thank our readers, our contributors and researchers, and our editorial board for their time and effort that had gone into the development of this issue.
As we look at the RMRJ, it represents innovation and the collective thinking of a group to satisfy the thirst and hunger for knowledge. It is a known fact that part of human nature is its curiosity and naturally intrigued.
The RMRJ seeks to be the leader in promoting multidisciplinary research. It believes that multidisciplinary research shall be the gold standard of the entire scientific paradigm. It encourages different researchers from different fields to form and engage in solving different, complex scientific problems, innovating to improve our lives, and understanding human nature. At our time right now, there has been an increase undertaking of multiple disciplines being discussed under a single subject, increasing the need for us to engage in multidisciplinary studies.
We want RMRJ as one of the forefront journals that would make a great difference and impact on the academic community. That is why it is one of our next goals in the future to be indexed under SCOPUS. We would do our best to make sure we achieve that goal and keep being an avenue of multidisciplinary research.
