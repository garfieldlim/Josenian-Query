Abstract
This study aims to identify whether the Senior High School students are Linguistic, Discourse, Sociolinguistic or Strategic Competent in English. Quantitative and qualitative research methods were used to collate a survey that would sure mend the study. With comprehensive computation of the random datasets, almost every Senior High School student achieved a satisfactory rating in both the Perceptions and Abilities Categories. A Chi-Square Statistic was also used and yielded maximum values which consequently, resulted to low p-values, suggesting the negation of the studyâ€™s null hypothesis. The result is further supported using the correlation statistic which corresponds to a high correlation between the studentsâ€™ Perceptions and Abilities in their speaking competence. The outcome of the summary of all competencies show that the Linguistic Competence contributed the most to the overall language intents of the students with sociolinguistic competence giving the least, which results in Linguistic Competence being the widely used language competency and sociolinguistic as not often practiced language skill amongst the students. With this, the Senior High School students are far more competent in phonetics, pronunciation, Phonology, Morphology, Syntax and Semantics rather than on the socio-cultural languages such as vocabulary, politeness and language style.
