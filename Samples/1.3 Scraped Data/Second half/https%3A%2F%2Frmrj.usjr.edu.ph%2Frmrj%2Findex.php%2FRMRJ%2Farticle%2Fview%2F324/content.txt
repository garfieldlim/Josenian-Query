Abstract
Recognizing the human dimension on participation to environmental conservation initiatives, this study determined the socio-economic characteristics of stakeholders in Bataan Coastal Resource Management (CRM) and how these variables influence their participation in the process. Data were collected through a survey. Four variables revealed to be independent indicators of high or poor CRM participation: the stakeholdersâ€™ locality income class, age, level of education, and household size. These indicators are important matters to cogitate for they are indirect drivers of the success or failure of CRM activities. It is concluded that Bataan CRM in the Philippines needs to be reviewed to tackle socio-economic barriers to engagement. Assessment of the process of selecting Bataan CRM participants; strengthened information, education, and communication component through an enriched content and rationalized delivery; institution of a unified CRM database system; and establishment of a provincial CRM research center are all recommended to counteract stakeholder estrangement and unresponsiveness to CRM efforts.
