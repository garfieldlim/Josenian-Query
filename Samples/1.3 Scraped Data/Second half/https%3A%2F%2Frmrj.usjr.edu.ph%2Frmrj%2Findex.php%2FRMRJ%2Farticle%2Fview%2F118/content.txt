Abstract
This study investigated the positioning of teacher education institutions (TEIs) in the glocalization continuum of bilingual complexities in responding to the global and local demands for harmonious and peaceful nation building. This study was exploratory in nature. The researchers used survey questionnaires to account the effects of more than four decades of enforcement of Bilingual Education in the Microcosm area in Cebu City (Philippines).Stratified sampling technique was employed; wherein strata were divided based on specialization of the 213 pre-service teachers. Cronbachâ€™sÂ alpha was usedto measure reliability and internal consistency of the instrument. Principle component method through factor analysis was utilized to reduce the data complexity and to identify important factors of bilingual education policy. Results revealed that bilingual education policy has duplicitous character in a non-native English country. Yet, it is a tool that can propel nation building. Much of it lies in the hands of the teacher education institutionsâ€™ power and capacity to ignite other industries of the country.
