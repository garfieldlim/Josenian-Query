Abstract
This study aimed to determine the predictors of subjective wellbeing among elderly. The researcher utilized a descriptive correlational design to identify patterns of relationship that existed between the variables and to measure the strength of the relationship, which in this case involved the individual variables (educational attainment, health status, employment status, and presence of stressors), family variables (marital status, family size, family income, quality of family relationship, and family support) and social characteristics (social relationships, church attendance, access to amenities/ transportation, safe environment and community participation) and the level of subjective wellbeing among the elderly. The study was conducted in the municipality of Sagbayan, Bohol, Philippines. The researcher utilized a self-made questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale, Spiritual Wellbeing Scale and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) to gather the needed information relevant to the variables under study. Multiple regression and analysis of variance through the SPSS software were utilized in the treatment and analysis of the data. It was found out that the mean level of subjective wellbeing among elderly falls under the average level of life satisfaction which means that the elderlies are generally satisfied with the different aspects of their lives but there are certain domains that they would very much like to improve. The study also revealed that the significant predictive variables for the elderliesâ€™ subjective wellbeing include age, health status, perceived stress, community participation, family income, and neighborhood safety. Implications of these results are noted for the development of programs and initiatives to enhance subjective wellbeing.
