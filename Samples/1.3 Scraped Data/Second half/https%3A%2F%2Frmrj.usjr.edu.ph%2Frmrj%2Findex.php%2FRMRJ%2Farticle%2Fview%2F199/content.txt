Abstract
Using a camera for measurement reading is simplified through the incorporation of computer vision application. The variations in the environmentâ€™s setting, however, may constitute to the occurrence of measurement errors. A study investigated the significant effect of changing the camera-to-lens displacements and the variations of the illumination level on the short-distance measurement reading. This is performed initially by developing an actual setup calibrated though the comparison with the hypothesized values. Then, an experiment on this calibrated setup generates the measurement results of varying the displacement positions and the illumination levels. Through descriptive and comparative statistical analysis, there is evidence that the variations of the displacement alone do not significantly change the measurement results. Similarly, the variations in the illumination levels do not also constitute significant changes on the measurement results. Hence, each of the variables bears no contribution on the occurrence of the measurement error of using camera. It is further confirmed through the two way analysis of variance that there is no significant difference on the displacement positions and illumination levels, and on their interactions. These results verified that a camera can be used as a short-distance measurement tool adequately regardless on the object-to-lens displacement positions and on the illumination levels.
