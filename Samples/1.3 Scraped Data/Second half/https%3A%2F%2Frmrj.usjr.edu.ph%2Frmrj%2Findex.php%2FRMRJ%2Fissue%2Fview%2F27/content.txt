Vol. 8 No. 2 (2020)
Wishing you a Blissful New Year!
The year 2020 was challenging for everyone. Yet, it brought lessons, growth, and new ways of doing things.
In this issue of the RMRJ, we will look into the importance of research in the Configuration of Research Culture: Investment, Process, and Norm.
Innovations and looking at things with fresh perspectives will be essayed in theAnalysis and Forecasting of Fire Incidence in Davao City, Wordnet Semantic Relations in a Chatbot, Ratooning Response of Lowland Rice NSIC Rc352 (Oryza sativa L.) to Method of Nitrogen Application, DSS Framework: A proposal for a Disaster Logistic Support System for the Province of Laguna, and Kakugi Ko, Kalambuan Mo (KKK Mo) as an Extension Program for Daycare Workers: An Impact Study.
The realities that we experienced during this pandemic will also be investigated in the Graduate Education during COVID-19 Pandemic: Inputs to Policy Formulation in the New Normal and the Direct and Indirect Effects to Teachersâ€™ Burnout in the New Normal.
The year ahead might be uncertain, but the flicker of hope in each one of us must be kept alive. May RMRJ be an instrument of fanning that hope in individuals and academic communities it reached.
