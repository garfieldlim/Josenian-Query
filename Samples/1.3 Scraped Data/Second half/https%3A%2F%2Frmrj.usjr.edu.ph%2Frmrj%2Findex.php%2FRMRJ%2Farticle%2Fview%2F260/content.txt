Abstract
This study determines why Gross Regional Domestic Product per Capita (GRDP) differs across regions in the Philippines vis-Ã -vis population rate, tertiary graduate rate, and crime rate as factors. Using Minitab, it examines the secondary data sets based on every group from various regions of the country. Findings show that educated human capital converge more in highly developed areas where risks matter less and safety measures exist. This results to a concentrated high GRDP in some. It further reveals that index and non-index crime rate is not a hindrance for a person to move in the area with many opportunities as long as life is not at stake. There were more educated individuals in regions with lower GRDP; however, they practiced and worked in highly developed areas and where law is enforced, eyeing a better condition of life. By implication, it results to concentration of educated labor force in areas with better opportunities.
