Abstract
The adverse effect of depression, which is a significant health problem associated with loneliness and social isolation, leads to suicidal ideation, alcohol use, cardiovascular disease, and altered brain function. Administering them with appropriate and effective mental health outreach and treatment services can prevent and alleviate these effects. Studies state that being with individuals who can help them cope with their situation under the supervision of a professional psychologist or psychiatrist can help them achieve a state of well-being. Thus, this study develops Companion, an app that utilizes the KNN algorithm to create a social support group that matches a seeker to the group based on his interest and problem at hand. He finds new friends with whom he can feel a sense of care, love, understanding, and belongingness. It comes with a set of physical activities designed for the group. The algorithm yields an 84% accuracy rate after evaluating the result.
