Abstract
This study determined the indicators for an improved faculty accomplishment based on selected profile (age, the number of years of teaching, performance rating, and salary), Common Criteria for Evaluation or CCE (educational qualification, professional achievements, and academic experience) and Qualitative Contribution Evaluation (QCE) ratings. One hundred percent (160) of faculty with ratings in the NBC- 461 6th cycle comprised the respondent which was evidently adequate as sample based on Kaiserâ€“Meyerâ€“Olkin (KMO) results. The Bartlettâ€™s test of sphericity indicates that variables are well-defined for Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The pre-defined indicators were categorized as indexes labeled as Input-Process-Output-Outcome. Results show that change in the Outcome of HE varies depending on the variables involved in the analysis. Considering full data, data with QCE and data of senior faculty, Inputs, Processes, and Outputs significantly contribute towards an improved (Outcome) faculty accomplishment (FA). The analysis on junior faculty (JF), showed that only Inputs and Outputs were significantly affecting change on Outcome of HE. Moreover, the most significantly affecting indicators towards faculty accomplishments are performance rating, age, and number of years of teaching. Then educational qualification followed, next are professional achievement and academic experience, and lastly the QCE.
Author Biography
Juanita M Costillas, Southern Leyte State University
Juanita M. Costillas is a Professor 5 of Southern Leyte State University.-Main Campus of Sogod, Southern Leyte, Philippines who finished her Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics Education from the University of the Philippines Open University, Los, BaÃ±os, Laguna. She finished her Master of Arts in Mathematics at the University of the Philippines, Diliman, Quezon City and her Bachelor of Secondary Education major in Mathematics at Saint Joseph College, Maasin City, Southern Leyte. She is a two-time Faculty of the Year awardee in her university (2012 and 2017), a Lingkod Bayan awardee(2013), and a Regional Research In-house Review first placer (2006). Her work in research cut across various disciplines but most are focused on Mathematics Education both in pedagogical and management aspects. She verified the contribution of contextualised teaching on improving the problems solving skills of students in Mathematics. In addition, she was able to make connections between traditions and algebra through an explanation of Finger Mathematics, a traditional routine in getting product of two numbers using fingers, through Binomial Expansion. She further analyzed how Brain-Based Teaching facilitates and sustain critical thinking. Due to the emerging use of technology in teaching Mathematics, she is working on Hybrid Modality of Learning (HML) in a blended context, its effects on critical thinking and problem-solving skills among students. Having exposed to administrative functions for 16 years, she is doing researches on modeling instructional competence via leadership practices among faculty designated with administrative functions and other related studies. She is currently working on researches about money value such as computing marginal rate of return of governmentâ€™s investment on instruction among State Universities and Colleges in the Philippines, screening indicators of faculty accomplishments, and others.
