Abstract
The study explored on the ethical dilemmas of human resource managers and uncovered the process by which the managers resolve the dilemmas. This study used a grounded theory approach to formulate a basic social process model (theoretical model) of resolving those moral conflicts. All informants are human resource managers from private higher education institutions. The study followed the Glasserian grounded theory analysis to formulate a resolution process theory using the data gathered from the beginning. With the use of grounded theory analysis, it was found out that the six main processes used by the informants were (1) Consistency with policies; (2) Character check; (3) Considering consequences; (4) Communication; (5) Cultural sensitivity; and (6) Counteractive mechanism.
