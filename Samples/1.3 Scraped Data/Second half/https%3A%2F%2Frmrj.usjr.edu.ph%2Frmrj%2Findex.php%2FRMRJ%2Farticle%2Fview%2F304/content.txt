Abstract
With the advancing technology, online shopping is pacing fast. This calls for looking into factors that influence a consumerâ€™s decision to buy online. With this, the present study investigated four variables namely consumer innovativeness, perceived benefit, perceived risk, and brand image and its impact toward consumerâ€™s decision to buy online. To address this aim, four hundred eighty (480) participants were recruited online and randomly assigned into one of the sixteen treatment conditions with the presence and/or absence of the four variables being investigated. Results of two-way analysis of variance showed that, in an online selling platform, the presence of consumer innovativeness and perceived benefit, the presence of perceived benefit and perceived risk, and brand image had significant influence in oneâ€™s decision to buy online. Findings provide implications towards improving an online websiteâ€™s shopping platform which may motivate the consumer to buy.
