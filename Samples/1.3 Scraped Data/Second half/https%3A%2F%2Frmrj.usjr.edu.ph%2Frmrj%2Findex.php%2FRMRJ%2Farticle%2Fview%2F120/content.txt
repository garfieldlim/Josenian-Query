Abstract
Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are considered viable alternatives due to their inherent advantages over traditional materials. Their advantages include light weight, high specific strength, high durability, corrosion resistance, chemical and environmental resistance, and low maintenance cost.Â  This innovative material has been globally applied into civil infrastructure. In Australia, the applications include composite pile system and rehabilitation, marine structures, bridge structures and electrical cross-arms. On the other hand, strengthening of bridge and building structures are the common application of fiber composites in the Philippines.Â  This paper presents the recent developments on the application of FRP composites in Australia and in the Philippines. Challenges in the implementation of this material are also presented. It is hoped that with the information revealed in this study, it will gain further application of this innovative material into civil infrastructure here in the Philippines.
