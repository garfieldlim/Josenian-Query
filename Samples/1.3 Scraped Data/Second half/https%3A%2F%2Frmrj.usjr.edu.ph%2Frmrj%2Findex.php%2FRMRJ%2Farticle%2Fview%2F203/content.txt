Abstract
Efficiency of beekeeping industry depends not only on honeybee strains, its management and hive structures, but also on the abundance, availability and proper utilization of bee flora around bee farming areas. The present investigation was conducted in three barangays in Northwestern Cagayan covering Culao, Sitio Nagbaranganan in Centro 2 and Balingit from March 2014 to April 2015. Â The study used a descriptive survey method to identify the diversity of melliferous resources and to develop a floral calendar in relation to pollen and nectar availability in the area. Data was analyzed using a frequency count. Â In the three vegetations sampled, 54 plant species are useful to honeybees, 27 of which are forest trees, 25 are agricultural crops, and one each is a shrub and a weed. The study ascertained 18 flowering plants as extremely important bee floras since these blossom throughout the year. March to May were identified as the honey flow periods.Â  July to September (dry season) and October to December (rainy season) were the dearth periods for honeybees in the study area. A floral calendar was developed based on the characteristics, abundance, time and duration of bloom of the bee flora. Â Northwestern Cagayan is suitable to initiate bee farming.
