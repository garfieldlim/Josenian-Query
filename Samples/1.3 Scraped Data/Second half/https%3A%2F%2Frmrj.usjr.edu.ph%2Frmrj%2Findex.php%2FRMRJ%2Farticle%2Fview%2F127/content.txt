Abstract
This paper aims to analyze the interest generated in social media of posts that were originally, just local or national concerns; yet, in time, became global phenomena. It studies two recent phenomena: the Arab Spring and Psysâ€™ Gangnam Style which demonstrate the transformative power of social media. Using secondary online data through data mining method, it looked into the Arab Spring incident and the popular video of Psy â€œThe Gangnam Style, â€œ which is a global Â sensation. Results reveal the spread of popularity across the world of the two from being mere national phenomena. Â This validates the theory used in this study.
