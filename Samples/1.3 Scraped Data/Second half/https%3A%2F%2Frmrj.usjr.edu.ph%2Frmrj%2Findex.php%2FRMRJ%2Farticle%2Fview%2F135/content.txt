Abstract
The importance of studentâ€™s evaluation for promotion leads teachers to be lenient in exchange of a good evaluation result.Â  This study looks into the possible effects of midterm grades to the evaluation results of teachers at the end of the semester.Â  The study utilized data mining approach using midterm grades and evaluation results of full-time and part-time faculty members.Â  Both parametric and non-parametric analyses were employed in the study. Findings revealed a weak correlation between the midterm grades of students and their evaluation rating of teachers.Â  Looking at grading leniency versus teacher status, it was found out that grades of full-time faculty was significantly higher compared to part time and grades of tenured faculty was significantly higher compared to their probationary counterpart.Â  Therefore, administrators in higher education institution, who uses studentâ€™s evaluation result as a key indicator of instructorâ€™s effectiveness, should be very careful as these results might not represent the true performance of a teacher inside the classroom.
