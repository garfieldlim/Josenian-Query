Abstract
This narrative review examined the philosophical bases of research methods interms of: (1) axiology; and (2) methodology. This explored the diversities and similarities between paradigms. Three search strategies were observed including: (1) data search for published research; (2) public engine and manual search; and (3) stakeholders input. Subthemes under axiologic assumptions are: (1) fact-value divide/dichotomy; and (2) ethics. Subthemes under methodologic assumptions are: (1) scientific vs naturalism: hard vs soft science; (2) convergence and divergence; (3) linearity is only in the books and not in practice; (4) hard or easy; (5) theory, frameworks and literature review; (6) nonstatistical approaches in positivistic approaches; and (7) complementarity. The focus of the lens is guided by philosophical stances. Each paradigm seeks truth, reality and knowledge. Though quantitative claimed objectivity and qualitative claim subjectivity, both unconsciously observe the same processes. The division is a continuum that delights its deficiencies. This is when divergence converges.
