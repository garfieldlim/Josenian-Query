Abstract
The remarkable growth of human knowledge is perhaps the greatest key to achieving what one wants, or what the whole economic society wants. Recognizing knowledge as one of the critical factors for economic advancement in the most multilateral organization in Asia, this study evaluates the indicators which determine the knowledge level of the ASEAN member nations. The study takes a look at factors that are predominant in the countries involved, in terms of general competency, inventions and innovations, and technological advancement. Data relating to high technology exports, human development, research and development, journals, researchers, and patents are takeninto consideration to quantify these factors in the assessment of the knowledge level of a country. These indicators are considered significant measures of a countryâ€™s intellectual standing, emphasizing that one should focus on these measures for the attainment of its advancement in the competitive organization.
