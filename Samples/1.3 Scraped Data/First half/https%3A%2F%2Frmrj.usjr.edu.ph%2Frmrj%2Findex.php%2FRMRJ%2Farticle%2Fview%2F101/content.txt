Abstract
This study seeks to explain and analyze the behavior of the Philippines and TheUnited States in forging the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Treaty (EDCA). It employs International Relations theories namely Realism, Liberalism and Constructivism as frameworks of analysis and interpretation. In the perspective of realism, EDCA is a joint interest of the Philippines and US. EDCA is an act or move of the US as it balances Chinaâ€™s rise to power in order to avoid war and anarchy and protect US interest in the Asia Pacific region. EDCA serves as deterrence to China or to any would-be aggressor to the Philippines in the midst of territorial and maritime disputes. In the point of view of liberalism, the EDCA is a reaffirmation and the strengthening of the alliance of two democratic states promoting military, economic, civic, and humanitarian cooperation and interdependence. In the spirit of constructivism, EDCA is also a product ofdemocratic ideas and norms that the US and Philippines share as democratic states. The United States serves as a norm entrepreneur to the Philippines and other states in the Pacific Rim. Therefore, EDCA is necessary, practical, and beneficial to the Philippines and the United States.
