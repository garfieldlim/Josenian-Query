Abstract
This study examined the worth of investing in Airbus and Boeing to determine which company yields better investment prospect in the future. In order to do so, the study compares Airbus and Boeing in terms of net income, earnings per share, and performance in terms of order intake and delivery. The study was limited to only the two major aircraft manufacturers which are Airbus and Boeing. Also, the study uses secondary data from 1999- 2013 from both Airbus and Boeing. All of the computations were derived using Minitab and MS excel. The study found that there is a significant difference between Boeing and Airbusâ€™s net income stability with Boeing being more stable than Airbus. Also, their earnings per share, when compared, found that Boeing provided their investors with larger earnings. Lastly, when the performance of both companies was compared, there was a significant difference between Boeing and Airbusâ€™s level of efficiency and it resulted in Boeing being more efficient. The findings indicate that Boeing is a wiser investment compared to Airbus. There has been a lot of arguments and literature comparing both Airbus and Boeing but none provides investors with information as to which company to choose. Because of the lack of research on this specific issue, this study aims to provide further information on Airbus and Boeing to investors.
