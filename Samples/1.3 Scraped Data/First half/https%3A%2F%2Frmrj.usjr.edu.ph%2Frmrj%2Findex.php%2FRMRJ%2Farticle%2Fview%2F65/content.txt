Abstract
Fractional and fractal derivatives are both generalizations of the usual derivatives that consider derivatives of non-integer orders. Interest in these generalizations has been triggered by a resurgence of clamor to develop a mathematical tool to describe â€œroughnessâ€ in the spirit of Mandelbrotâ€™s (1967) fractal geometry. Fractional derivatives take the analytic approach towards developing a rational order derivative while fractal derivatives follow a more concrete, albeit geometric approach to the same end. Since both approaches alleged to extend whole derivatives to rational derivatives, it is not surprising that confusion will arise over which generalization to use in practice. This paper attempts to highlight the connection between the various generalizations to fractional and fractal derivatives with the end-in-view of making these concepts useful in various physics applications and to resolve some of the confusion thatarise out of the fundamental philosophical differences in the derivation of fractional derivatives (non-local concept) and fractal derivatives (local concept).

Roberto N. Padua
Dr. Roberto Natividad Padua, scientist, received his PhD in Mathematical Statistics from Clemson University, South Carolina, USA under the Fullbright-Hays scholarship grant. He is an accomplished author, a multi-awarded researcher and an internationally acclaimed lecturer. Dr. Padua is a former Commissioner of CHED and currently a consultant to several state and private universities. He is also conducting lectures on research and Fractal Statistics. Dr. Padua is a Summa Cum Laude, BS in Mathematics Teaching graduate from the Philippine Normal College under the National Science Development Board (NSDB) program. He obtained his MS in Mathematics Education Degree from the Centro Escolar University as a Presidential Scholar.
Gibson T. Maglasang, Cebu Normal University
is currently Instructor I at the Department of Chem-Physics of Cebu Normal University, Cebu City, Philippines. He completed his degree in Physics, in 2009 at the Mindanao State University â€“ Iligan Institute of Technology and was awarded as Cum Laude. He obtained his MS Physics, in 2011 at the same university. The author has been an active member of the Samahang Pisika ng Visayas at Mindanao and has participated and presented various studies in SPVM national conference and workshop from 2008-2012 relating to theoretical and mathematical physics research topics. His areas of interest include mathematical and theoretical physics, quantum physics, biophysics, astrophysics, and computational physics.
