Abstract
This paper tried to assess the performance of the cooperatives using a surrogate measure of data roughness through fractal dimensions. Fractal dimensions as statistical quantities are robust measures which are not easily influenced by extreme observations unlike other variancebased performance measures. This study used the data of the 35 farmersâ€™ cooperatives in Misamis Occidental provided by the Department of Agrarian Reform. The fractal dimensions on membership, farm and off-farm income of members, capital build up, savings mobilization, assets and liabilities were measured through the fractal software. The results revealed that all the variables mentioned had high fractal dimensions. The farm and non-farm income of the members and the number of members with capital build up had the lowest fractal dimensions while the general membership and assets had the highest ones. The implication is that thevariables with higher fractal dimensions are more volatile and unpredictable than those with lower fractal dimensions. In particular, the farm and non-farm incomes are unreliable as indicators of financial stability of the economic conditions of the member farmers.
