Abstract
Tubog, Ficus nota (Blanco) Merr a rare tree in the Philippines and was found in Barangay Tambis, Barobo, Surigao del Sur. The present study designed to evaluate the antibacterial activities of Tubog,Ficus nota (Blanco) Merr fruit and leaves with ethanolic extracts. Preliminary phytochemical and histochemical studies were carried out. The antimicrobial activity of the fruit extract against pathogenic strains evaluated based on the zone of inhibition using paper disc diffusion method with tested bacteria of Escherichia coli ATTC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATTC 25923, Klebsiella pneumonia UPCC 1360, and Salmonella typhimurium UPCC 1368.The qualitative phytochemical tests exhibited the presence of common bioactive compounds including alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, saponins, flavonoids and anthraquinones. The aqueous extract has shown high activity in ethanolic extract has shown significantly good activity when compared to standard chemotherapeutic agent Chloramphenicol. Based on the result it was concluded that Ficus nota are rich in bioactive components and exhibits antimicrobial activity against pathogens. Cytotoxicity result showed higher toxicity with the fruit compared with ficus nota leaves ethanolic extract.
