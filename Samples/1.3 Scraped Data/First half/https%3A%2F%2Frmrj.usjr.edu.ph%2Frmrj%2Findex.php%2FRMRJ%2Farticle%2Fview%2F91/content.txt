Abstract
This study aims to compare the classroom practices of teacher interns in terms of lesson planning, classroom management and assessment during the teaching of English in the primary schools in the countries of Taiwan and Philippines. Document analysis, field notes, internsâ€™ reflective daily journals, and classroom observations were used during the data collection of this study. Results show that there are significant similarities and differences in the classroom practices of the teaching of English of the two countries in terms of lesson planning, classroom management and assessment. The two countries differ in the way they organized instruction of internship courses. To prepare more innovative and quality teachers in English starts from the teacher training where pedagogical knowledge is developed during the pre-service years that includes the pre-service teaching program.
