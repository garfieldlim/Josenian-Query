Abstract
This study investigates the effectiveness of the Mother-Tongue Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE) Certificate Program to the academic performance of pupils utilizing their first language in learning. Teacher-scholarsâ€™ performance were measured in terms of teaching-learning and teaching facilitation. Moreover, pupilsâ€™ satisfaction level were determined based on the comparison of teachersâ€™ performance as scholars, trained and non-trained. The findings of this study revealed that teacher-scholars who enrolled in the certificate program showed positive and direct effect to pupilsâ€™ academic performance. An increase of pupilsâ€™ achievement and satisfaction level towards learning using MTB-MLE as a medium of instruction was grounded on the intensity of teachersâ€™ training about the implementation of MTB-MLE in each grade level. Furthermore, scrutinizing the differences of both teachersâ€™ performance and pupilsâ€™ performance in Grades 1-3 will be helpful in determining more provisions to make the K to 12 implementation more effective and more understandable to individuals within the cycle of learning.
