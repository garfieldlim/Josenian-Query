Abstract
This study validates the theory on the psychological anatomy of gossip. A personâ€™s inclination to gossip is tested and validated in relation to oneâ€™s self-concept and anxiety level. Utilizing researcher-developed questionnaires and employing regression analysis, this paper tested the relationship between a personâ€™s self- concept and anxieties with oneâ€™s propensity to gossip. The results of this study supported our three hypotheses: (1) that a personâ€™s self-concept is inversely related to oneâ€™s anxieties, (2) that a personâ€™s self-concept is inversely related to oneâ€™s propensity to gossip, and (3) a personâ€™s anxiety is directly related to oneâ€™s tendency to gossip.
