Abstract
The study examines the effects of the confidence level in the church, along with other factors, on the quality of life of the citizens of a country. These factors include confidence in the Church, contraception prevalence, corruption index, life satisfaction, population, and gross domestic product. Quality of life is an individualâ€™s perception of his/her position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which he/she lives and in relation to his/her goals. This lends credence also to the Quality of Life Theory (Frisch, 2005). The results of the study show that countries with higher income have a higher level of confidence in the Church and higher life satisfaction. The results also manifest that countries with high population also have higher contraception prevalence but the lowest corruption index. These results only tell that religion has relatively positive effects on the quality of life of a countryâ€™s citizens.
