Abstract
This study compares the fractal dimensions of certain characteristics of the aging population which exhibited irregularity in patterns such as population distribution, life expectancy and living arrangements in developed and developing countries. Data were gathered from on-line data base of United Nations organization. Findings revealed that the fractal dimension of living arrangement is 1.11 which is greater than that of life expectancy at 1.07. Fractal dimension of older population is 1.07, while the fractal dimension of living arrangement is 1.04. It is concluded that demographic distributionsin older adults are better predicted at a higher fractal dimension. It is concluded further that living arrangement and older population can reduce variability of distribution in life expectancy and living arrangement respectively.
