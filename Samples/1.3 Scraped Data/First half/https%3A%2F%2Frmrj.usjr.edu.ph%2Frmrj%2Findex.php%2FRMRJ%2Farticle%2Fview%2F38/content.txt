Abstract
This study explores the fractal dimensions of studentsâ€™ cognitive skills accordingto the levels of difficulty using fractal model approach and analysis. The data utilized were from the test results based on the competency-based constructed items. Findings revealed that data sets obey a non- normal distribution as depicted in histograms and normality tests that yield to fractal statistical analysis. Hence, subjects with lesser fractal dimension and disparity value tend to be less rough and rugged whereas subjects with higher fractal dimension and high disparity value is perceived to be more irregular. This result has a great impact in exploring the fractality of test scores that will lead to a deeper understanding on studentsâ€™ authentic performance with a direct, relevant and realistic application of learning as emphasized in the implementation of Outcomes-based Education (OBE).
