Abstract
Human sexual partnership has evolved over time, from single partnerships tomultiple partnerships. The reasons for people engaging these sexual relationshiparrangements vary from person to person. Some studies have already been made about multiple sexual partnership that evokes the biological needs of humans, but the occurrence of MSP due to social modelling has bunked to be unstudied and was not explored thoroughly. This study examines the underlying reasons and practice of multiple sexual partnerships through societal exemplifications, understanding of individualsâ€™ preference towards pleasure not just by manâ€™s innate biological needs. The formulated theory in this study describes, explains and justifies the enumeratedreasons of committing multiple sexual partners outside or within the context ofmarriage. With it, this study relinquishes another perspective about the occurrence of multiple sexual partnerships.
