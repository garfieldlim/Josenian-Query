Abstract
The study explained and interpreted Philippine history using the main themes ofFriedrich Nietzscheâ€™s philosophy such as, Will to Power, the Uebermensch/superman, the Transvaluation of values, Master and Slave morality, Eternal recurrence, and tragedy. Further, this study employed qualitative interpretive analysis as method. Nietzscheâ€™s philosophy emphasizes the role of the Will over reason as the most fundamental principle of human existence. The Will which he refers to as Will to Power is the impetus behind thestruggle for power, conquest, war, revolt, revolution and freedom. Similarly, the will to power gives the Filipinos the hope and courage to go through pain, suffering and despair. The assertion of Will to Power has produced the great men and women behind events of Philippine history. These supermen are responsible for the creation or the introduction of new values system, of reform and even of revolution (trans-valuation of values). The event of Philippine history follows a pattern of recurrence, the recurrence of colonization, war,independence, pain, and corruption. The study also found out that Philippine history in general is a tragedy; it is a struggle against suffering and despair.
