Abstract
Depression lurks in peopleâ€™s lives.The intensity of the feelings, causes and reactions vary from person to person.It is within this nature of depression that the study would explore the fractality of the phenomenon. The data were obtained by conducting the Goldberg Depression Inventory among a hundred young adults enrolled from each of the six colleges of the university. Findings show that most of the data do not obey normal distribution as evident in this histogram and normality tests. Hence, they were subjected to a fractal statistical analysis. Fractal dimensions and scales for each college depression scores were determined. It was found out that the level of depression among the young adults of the different colleges were leaning towards the mild level of depression. In view of the fractal dimensions, it is evident that young adults had varied coping mechanisms against depression.
