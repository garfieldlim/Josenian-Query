Abstract
This paper recognizes the forthcoming integration of ASEAN, the most significantmultilateral organization in Asia. It is undeniable that in the unification process, the branding of a member state is critical to boost its economic and social development. The study takes an in-depth look at other factors prevalent among ASEAN member nations, in terms of overall well-being, global market confidence, tourism attractiveness and investment climate. To quantify these indicators in assessing the nationâ€™s brand equity, the researchers utilize the data depicting the corruption perception index and the gross domestic product. Data related to the foreign direct investments, foreign tourist arrivals, export of goods and services and the Human Development Index are also considered.These indices are deemed significant measures indicative of a countryâ€™s performance, emphasizing that an ASEAN member nation should first work on its strength in branding itself individually before positioning in a competitive economic community.
