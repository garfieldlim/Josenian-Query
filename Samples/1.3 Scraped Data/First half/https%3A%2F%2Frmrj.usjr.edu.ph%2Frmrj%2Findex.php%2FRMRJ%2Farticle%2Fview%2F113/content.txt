Abstract
The concepts of morality and religiosity have been associated with each other in a manner that these two co-exist and they are of equal importance for a human personâ€™s eventual ideal character. Accordingly, moral philosophy teaches that a personâ€™s moral foundation can be linked to his spiritual foundation and vice versa as one of religionsâ€™ thrusts is construct the moral fibers necessary for manâ€™s ethical existence. A human personâ€™s spirituality and morality are substantial parts of his nature that he has to learn, nourish and value them so that he may develop into an ideal human person that he is suppose to be. He does not only have to indoctrinate and inculcate one of which and despise the other. This paper generally talks about the notions of Morality and Religiosity. Further, it also discusses on the interrelation of the two as the human person applies the same to actual convictions in life. Finally, a category is presented on what a person should ideally be as the two concepts are intertwined. This paper utilized the expository-descriptive type of research. Books, articles and other similar write-ups from the library, internet and other sources coupled with observations in the experiential world were the primary references. Such method was facilitative in the full realization of this research paper.
