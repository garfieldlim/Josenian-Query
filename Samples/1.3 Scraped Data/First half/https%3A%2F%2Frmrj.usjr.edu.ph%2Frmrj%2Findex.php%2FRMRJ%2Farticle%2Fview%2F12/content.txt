Abstract
In an era known as the green movement where businesses are attracted to produce environment-friendly goods, it is inevitable that additional costs are needed which are referred to as the â€œgreen premiumâ€ in this study. This simulation model aims to predict the number of customers who would continually patronize the business in spite of the premium. It is worth noting that the buyerâ€™s willingness and awareness should form part of the picture. It is then determined that there is only a minimal number of customers who will remain loyal hence, giving rise to businessesâ€™ implementation of strong green marketing strategies.
