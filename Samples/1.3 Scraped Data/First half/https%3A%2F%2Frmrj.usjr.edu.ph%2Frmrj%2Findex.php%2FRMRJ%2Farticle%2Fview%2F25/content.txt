Abstract
Responding to the challenges of global employment, universities recognize the need to produce graduates who meet the ever-changing demands of work and life in the national and global environment. This paper investigates the extent of practice of graduate attributes among graduating college students of a Catholic University. It determines the influence of graduate attributes in studentsâ€™ lives. Using a sequential explanatory mixed-method design, the findings revealed that the participants developed the graduate attributes to a high extent. Remarkable implication signifies that university education has successfully prepared and trained students to meet the challenges of national and global employment and industry.
