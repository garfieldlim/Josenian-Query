Abstract
Education is a basic means to reduce the level of poverty for each country. With an improved education, all other areas are directly or indirectly affected. Thus, educational attainment is a key constituent which triggers other areas of human development to flourish. This study aims to explore the impact of the educational attainment of a country relative to its income, health, demography and political instability by using a multivariate clustering method in deriving the relationship among the variables. Educational accomplishments imply better income, healthier citizens and politically stable country. Therefore upgrading the nationâ€™s educational system is hypothetically syllogistic to socioeconomic and political progress.
