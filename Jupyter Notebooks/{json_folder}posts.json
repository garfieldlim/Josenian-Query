\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\udded\n\nOn May 28, 1898, the Philippine Flag was first unfurled after the Philippine Revolutionary Army won against the Spanish Forces in Imus, Cavite.\n\nAs the country marks today the National Flag Day, get to know the meanings behind the Filipino flag. 2023-05-28T07:42:48 https://facebook.com/usjr.official/posts/632845565553852 The Philippine flag is the national flag of the Philippines and is an important symbol of national identity. It is composed of a horizontal rectangular design with a ratio of 1:2. The flag consists of two main colors: blue on top and red at the bottom, symbolizing peace, truth, and justice (blue) and patriotism and valor (red).\n\nIn the middle of the blue stripe, there is an equilateral triangle with a white border containing three yellow five-pointed stars. Each star represents the three main geographical regions of the Philippines: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.\n\nInside the triangle, there is a yellow sun with eight rays representing the eight provinces that first revolted against Spanish colonial rule. The sun's face symbolizes liberty, while the rays represent the first eight provinces that fought for independence.\n\nThe Philippine flag has a deep historical significance and has undergone several changes in design throughout the years. It was first conceptualized by General Emilio Aguinaldo, the first President of the Philippines, and was officially adopted on June 12, 1898.\n\nEvery year, May 28 is celebrated as National Flag Day in the Philippines to promote patriotism and raise awareness about the importance of the national flag in Filipino society. It serves as a reminder of the country's struggles for freedom and sovereignty.\n\nThe Philippine flag is proudly displayed in various locations, such as government buildings, schools, and during national holidays and events.

It is composed of a horizontal rectangular design with a ratio of 1:2. The flag consists of two main colors: blue on top and red at the bottom, symbolizing peace, truth, and justice (blue) and patriotism and valor (red).\n\nIn the middle of the blue stripe, there is an equilateral triangle with a white border containing three yellow five-pointed stars. Each star represents the three main geographical regions of the Philippines: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.\n\nInside the triangle, there is a yellow sun with eight rays representing the eight provinces that first revolted against Spanish colonial rule. The sun's face symbolizes liberty, while the rays represent the first eight provinces that fought for independence.\n\nThe Philippine flag has a deep historical significance and has undergone several changes in design throughout the years. It was first conceptualized by General Emilio Aguinaldo, the first President of the Philippines, and was officially adopted on June 12, 1898.\n\nEvery year, May 28 is celebrated as National Flag Day in the Philippines to promote patriotism and raise awareness about the importance of the national flag in Filipino society. It serves as a reminder of the country's struggles for freedom and sovereignty.\n\nThe Philippine flag is proudly displayed in various locations, such as government buildings, schools, and during national holidays and events.

It is a reminder of the sacrifices made and the battles won to forge our identity as an independent nation.\n\nThroughout the years, we have faced numerous challenges and triumphs. From the struggles of the past to the accomplishments of the present, we have shown the world what it truly means to be a Filipino.\n\nAs we mark this milestone, let us remember and honor the heroes who have paved the way for our freedom.
