The program started with the opening remarks from Rev. Fr. Persiuz Decena, OAR, warmly welcoming the visitors from Nara Prefecture to the campus. Dr. Jestoni Babia, the former Dean of the USJ-R School of Education and Director of the Center of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) gave a very robust speech on the importance of cross-cultural activities especially in light of common ground pertaining to sustainable initiatives and socio-environmental consciousness.  Emphasizing the strategic significance of the USJ-R School of Education as a hub for both academic excellence and sustainable education, Prof. Ma. Aira Chenessa B. Aguilar, Chair of the Department of Teacher Education, laid out key milestones and achievements of the college that ranged from multiple won competitions on innovative pandemic-era teaching practices to various Scopus-indexed publications with particular focus on best scientific and research-based sustainability efforts. It is worth noting that the School of Education has been designated a Center of Excellence in Teacher Education since 1996.  Prof. Justine Marie Munez, Adviser of the Josenian Educators (JOED) organization, gave a detailed presentation of JOED\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ongoing efforts to continue aligning its priorities with those of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), particularly in the UN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). She enumerated several completed and future projects JOED has undertaken and will take part in to demonstrate the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laserlike focus on training Josenian educators not only to become quality teachers in the classroom but individuals who can be counted upon as responsible global citizens in a constantly changing society.  After a series of presentations on the intricacies of the Philippine educational system and Filipino culture, the Japanese visitors were on the receiving end of the \u00e2\u0080\u009clearning by doing\u00e2\u0080\u009d instructional approach as the JOED officers and selected SED students, in various stations, showcased the unique and original Filipino cuisine, dances, and games, and invited the Japanese students to take part in each category. The primary point of this segment of the program was to introduce the visitors to the rich cultural legacy of the Filipinos and to steer them toward appreciating these unique cultural attributes while recognizing the value of USJ-R SED as an institution firmly committed to cross-cultural efforts to enhance the sharing of best practices and prioritizing the pursuit of common goals toward a sustainable future.

The program started with the opening remarks from Rev. Fr. Persiuz Decena, OAR, warmly welcoming the visitors from Nara Prefecture to the campus. Dr. Jestoni Babia, the former Dean of the USJ-R School of Education and Director of the Center of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) gave a very robust speech on the importance of cross-cultural activities especially in light of common ground pertaining to sustainable initiatives and socio-environmental consciousness.  Emphasizing the strategic significance of the USJ-R School of Education as a hub for both academic excellence and sustainable education, Prof. Ma. Aira Chenessa B. Aguilar, Chair of the Department of Teacher Education, laid out key milestones and achievements of the college that ranged from multiple won competitions on innovative pandemic-era teaching practices to various Scopus-indexed publications with particular focus on best scientific and research-based sustainability efforts. It is worth noting that the School of Education has been designated a Center of Excellence in Teacher Education since 1996.  Prof. Justine Marie Munez, Adviser of the Josenian Educators (JOED) organization, gave a detailed presentation of JOED\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ongoing efforts to continue aligning its priorities with those of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), particularly in the UN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). She enumerated several completed and future projects JOED has undertaken and will take part in to demonstrate the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laserlike focus on training Josenian educators not only to become quality teachers in the classroom but individuals who can be counted upon as responsible global citizens in a constantly changing society.  After a series of presentations on the intricacies of the Philippine educational system and Filipino culture, the Japanese visitors were on the receiving end of the \u00e2\u0080\u009clearning by doing\u00e2\u0080\u009d instructional approach as the JOED officers and selected SED students, in various stations, showcased the unique and original Filipino cuisine, dances, and games, and invited the Japanese students to take part in each category. The primary point of this segment of the program was to introduce the visitors to the rich cultural legacy of the Filipinos and to steer them toward appreciating these unique cultural attributes while recognizing the value of USJ-R SED as an institution firmly committed to cross-cultural efforts to enhance the sharing of best practices and prioritizing the pursuit of common goals toward a sustainable future.  The success of the cultural immersion by our Japanese friends was yet another feather in the cap for the USJ-R School of Education and Josenian Educators organization in our continued drive toward the enhancement of the multi-pronged areas of quality instruction, strategic internationalization, and global citizenship. With this effort, expect more meaningful collaboration and productive partnerships to ensue between the School of Education and various entities from the governmental, civic, and academic communities from here and abroad to be forged and fostered. The continued exchange and sharing of innovative and forward-looking ideas and initiatives will only serve to help us in the School of Education deliver the kind of education and learning to mold our students in ultimately becoming not just excellent teachers in the classroom, but competent and reliable stewards of the world.  #SEDExcellence #TakingYouForwardSince1947 #JosenianEducators,"], ["dcd410b8-4edf-4469-9a27-fcafec2d70c6", {"time": "2023-06-12 June 12, 2023 08:56:24", "text": "Happy Independence Day \u00f0\u009f\u0087\u00b5\u00f0\u009f\u0087\u00ad  The 125th anniversary of Philippine Independence and Nationhood will be celebrated until 2026, with the theme \u00e2\u0080\u009cKalayaan.

Starting things off, Dr. Jestoni P. Babia, Dean of the School of Education, provided the opening remarks and noted the various achievements, as well as the significant challenges that lay ahead, within the college. He underscored that while SED has come this far regarding its innumerable accomplishments and milestones, important opportunities must be addressed and managed. He looked forward to future leadership having the creativity, initiative, and resourcefulness to fill the gaps and further enhance the enormously magnificent reputation SED has already carved out for itself. As a very important note, SED has maintained its gold-standard status as a Center of Excellence for Teacher Education, exemplifying its prestige as a go-to place for aspiring teachers who want nothing less than quality pedagogical instruction and training.  Multiple and various awards were given to both the students and faculty members. The awards night capped a yearlong grind by teachers and students who slugged it out against the numerous PowerPoint presentations, learning modules, reviews, reports, grades, and so much other paperwork they had to accomplish against a myriad of deadlines. In the end, the sleepless nights and seemingly bottomless iced coffee cups were all worth it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all for the sake of ensuring that both sides obtain the education and learning that would not only serve them well in the four corners of the classroom \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but in the contextualized reality of a continually unpredictable world. After all, Josenian Educators do not just teach; they inspire.

Starting things off, Dr. Jestoni P. Babia, Dean of the School of Education, provided the opening remarks and noted the various achievements, as well as the significant challenges that lay ahead, within the college. He underscored that while SED has come this far regarding its innumerable accomplishments and milestones, important opportunities must be addressed and managed. He looked forward to future leadership having the creativity, initiative, and resourcefulness to fill the gaps and further enhance the enormously magnificent reputation SED has already carved out for itself. As a very important note, SED has maintained its gold-standard status as a Center of Excellence for Teacher Education, exemplifying its prestige as a go-to place for aspiring teachers who want nothing less than quality pedagogical instruction and training.  Multiple and various awards were given to both the students and faculty members. The awards night capped a yearlong grind by teachers and students who slugged it out against the numerous PowerPoint presentations, learning modules, reviews, reports, grades, and so much other paperwork they had to accomplish against a myriad of deadlines. In the end, the sleepless nights and seemingly bottomless iced coffee cups were all worth it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all for the sake of ensuring that both sides obtain the education and learning that would not only serve them well in the four corners of the classroom \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but in the contextualized reality of a continually unpredictable world. After all, Josenian Educators do not just teach; they inspire.
