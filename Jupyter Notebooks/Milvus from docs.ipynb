After reading this page, you will learn what Milvus is and how it works, as well as the key concepts, why use Milvus, supported indexes and metrics, example applications, the architecture, and relevant tools.\\nWhat is Milvus vector database?\\nMilvus was created in 2019 with a singular goal: store, index, and manage massive embedding vectors generated by deep neural networks and other machine learning (ML) models.\\nAs a database specifically designed to handle queries over input vectors, it is capable of indexing vectors on a trillion scale. Unlike existing relational databases which mainly deal with structured data following a pre-defined pattern, Milvus is designed from the bottom-up to handle embedding vectors converted from unstructured data.\\nAs the Internet grew and evolved, unstructured data became more and more common, including emails, papers, IoT sensor data, Facebook photos, protein structures, and much more. In order for computers to understand and process unstructured data, these are converted into vectors using embedding techniques. Milvus stores and indexes these vectors. Milvus is able to analyze the correlation between two vectors by calculating their similarity distance. If the two embedding vectors are very similar, it means that the original data sources are similar as well.', metadata={'source': 'https://milvus.io/docs/overview.md', 'title': 'Introduction Milvus documentation', 'description': 'Milvus is an open-source vector database designed specifically for AI application development, embeddings similarity search, and MLOps v2.2.x.', 'language': 'en'}),\n",

This data type accounts for around 80% of the world's data, and can be converted into vectors using various artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models.\\nEmbedding vectors\\nAn embedding vector is a feature abstraction of unstructured data, such as emails, IoT sensor data, Instagram photos, protein structures, and much more. Mathematically speaking, an embedding vector is an array of floating-point numbers or binaries. Modern embedding techniques are used to convert unstructured data to embedding vectors.\\nVector similarity search\\nVector similarity search is the process of comparing a vector to a database to find vectors that are most similar to the query vector. Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithms are used to accelerate the searching process. If the two embedding vectors are very similar, it means that the original data sources are similar as well.\\nWhy Milvus?\", metadata={'source': 'https://milvus.io/docs/overview.md', 'title': 'Introduction Milvus documentation', 'description': 'Milvus is an open-source vector database designed specifically for AI application development, embeddings similarity search, and MLOps v2.2.x.', 'language': 'en'}),\n",
