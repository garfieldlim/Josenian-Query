Abstract
Health expenditure of a country is intended to finance medicines and other medical services and assistance for those people affected with diseases especially those communicable ones. The global issue of tuberculosis has been a well-known communicable disease which could result in another type of such disease, if untreated. This study is conducted to assess the treatment success of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases, which had been a burden for countries in terms of financial aspects. Through the use of multivariate cluster and principal component analyses, ASEAN countries were grouped and ranked from very highly successful to least successful in the level of treatment success which would provide comprehensive findings as to what ASEAN country successfully provides financial to their diagnosed patients. Further, it was found out that the level of success of MDR-TB treatments among ASEAN countries varies inversely with the number of patients undergoing the treatment while directly proportional to the amount of investments in health expenditures. Hence, MDR-TB treatment success depends on the level of amount of investments for health the ASEAN country has and the number of patients undergoing the treatment. Thus, the success of the treatment can be achieved at high economic price.
Author Biography
Ricky B. Villeta, University of San Jose-Recoletos
graduated from Mindanao State University â€“ Iligan Institute of Technology (MSU-IIT) with a degree of Bachelor of Science in Mathematics (Pure Mathematics) in 2003 as a fulltime scholar, City Mayorâ€™s scholar (Iligan City) granted from having graduated in high school as class valedictorian and CHED-COE (Center of Excellence in Mathematics) scholar awarded by MSU-IIT mathematics and statistics department. He also obtained his Master of Science in Mathematics degree in 2007, with a specialization in abstract algebra (group theory) at MSU-IIT. He had served as Mathematics Lecturer from 2003 to 2005 and as graduate teaching assistant from 2005 to 2006 at the Mathematics and Statistics Department of the College of Science and Mathematics of MSU-IIT. Since 2006 to present, he is a faculty member of the Department of Mathematics and Sciences of the College of Arts and Sciences at University of San Jose â€“ Recoletos (USJ-R), Cebu City. He has been teaching research methods, design of experiments and statistical models in the graduate school, differential equation, differential calculus, integral calculus, applied statistics in business, behavioral statistics, biostatistics, computer aided analysis, linear algebra, abstract algebra, number theory, probability theory, quantitative analysis in business, mathematical investigations and modeling, among others. He is also a trainer for basic and tertiary non-deped teachers on senior high curriculum in mathematics, statistics and probability areas in the Visayas region. His research works and interests are in abstract algebra (group theory), graph theory, differential equation, mathematical modeling and simulation, fractal statistics, data mining and theory development. He also serves as researcher and research statistician at the Center for Policy, Research and Development Studies in USJ-R.
