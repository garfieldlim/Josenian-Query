Abstract
This paper presents ways in teaching indigenous peace concepts from Visayan fisherfolks and farmers through their integration to the teaching of the Philosophy of the Human Person. This study aims to determine fisherfolks and farmers' notions of peace through the qualitative research method of hermeneutic phenomenology. This study finds out that the respondents understand peace through the concept of Kinabuhi sa Kinaiyahan , Gugma sa Isig ka TawoÂ  and Pagsalig ug Pagtuo sa Ginoo. These concepts are fit to be integrated in the four significant lessons of the course. This study concludes that this research has given marginalized people a chance to air their voices. This studyÂ also concludes that the integration Â  of indigenous peace concepts has made the teaching of Philosophy more meaningful and relevant.
