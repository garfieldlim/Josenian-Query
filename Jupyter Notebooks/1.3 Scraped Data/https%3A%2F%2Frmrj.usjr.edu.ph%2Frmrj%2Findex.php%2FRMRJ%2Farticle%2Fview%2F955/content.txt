Abstract
Shifting to online distance learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic challenged educators' roles as instructional materials designers. This study aimed to examine the students' acceptance of the teacher-designed e-learning tool called Google Forms-based Lesson Playlist (GF-LP) in a home-based online distance learning environment. This quantitative research analyzed 570 responses from Grades 11 and 12 students at a private school in the Philippines using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling. Results showed that perceived self-efficacy and system quality strongly affect the users' perceived ease of use while perceived ease of use highly influenced the students' perceived usefulness of GF-LP. Facilitating conditions do not affect the users' attitudes towards using the e-learning tool, which confirmed the effective utilization of GF-LP in online distance learning. The relationships between the original constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) were also presented. This study recommends the use of GF-LP or its features for remote learning.
