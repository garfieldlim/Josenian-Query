Abstract
This paper provides an approximate analytic solution to the three species Lotka â€“ Volterra differential equations by symbolic regression. The approximate analytic solution through symbolic regression is made as close as desired to the actual analytic solution by using the Jacobian system. This is proposed as the equilibrium will be stabilized if and only if the real parts of each of the eigenvalues are negative. As a result, the symbolic regression approach is found to provide an approximation to the faster convergence that can be expected with a more refined Euler numerical approach.
