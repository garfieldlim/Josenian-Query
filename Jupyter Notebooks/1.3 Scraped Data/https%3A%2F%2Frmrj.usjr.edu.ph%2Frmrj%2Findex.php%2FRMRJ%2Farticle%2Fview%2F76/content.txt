Abstract
This paper examines the reasons why young people engage in casual sex by investigating the reasons why an individual gives in to transitory pleasure. It also examines of the psyche of those who do not indulge in. It also leads to the formulation of a Casual Sex Theory that individuals who are highly rational and are self-actualized are not prone to casual sex. Thus, an individualâ€™s orientation that is anchored on the physiological and sexual aspects make him vulnerable to casual sex. Persons with hedonistic and pragmatic orientation are likely to engage in casual sex. In conclusion, an elevation of the level of awareness among young people from their rational capacity has to be given primary importance for the youth are the most vulnerable in casual sex phenomenon.
