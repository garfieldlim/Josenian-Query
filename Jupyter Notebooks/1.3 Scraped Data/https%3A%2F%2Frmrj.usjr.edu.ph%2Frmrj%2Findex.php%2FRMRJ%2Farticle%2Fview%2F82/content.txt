Abstract
The technological advancements of countries are varied, making the competition essentially uneven. Different studies had been made using a variety of determinants with the common objective of proposing theories on how to advance the technological capability of a country. This paper intends to look into the social, political and economic dimensions of countries that exemplify different degree of technological advancements, and determine how these factors affect the advancements. To derive the characteristics, data mining and multivariate clustering method were used. Technologically advanced countries demonstrate social and political characteristics that promote these advancements.
