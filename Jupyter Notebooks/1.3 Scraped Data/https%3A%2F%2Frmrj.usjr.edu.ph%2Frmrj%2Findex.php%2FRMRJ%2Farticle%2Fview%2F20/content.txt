Abstract
Fresh water withdrawals refer to the total fresh water withdrawn in a given year, expressed as a percentage of total renewable water resource. Withdrawals can exceed 100 percent of total renewable resource where extraction from nonrenewable aquifers or desalination plants is considerable or where there is significant water reuse. Exploratory data analysis using Fractal Statistics were used to determine significant information about the global freshwater extractions of the different countries. Fractal Statistics Analysis, has determinedthe data to be exponential in distribution across regions and the impact of water scarcity on countries is fractal. Other significant issues are over-extraction of underground water, fresh water depletion, and environmental degradation.
