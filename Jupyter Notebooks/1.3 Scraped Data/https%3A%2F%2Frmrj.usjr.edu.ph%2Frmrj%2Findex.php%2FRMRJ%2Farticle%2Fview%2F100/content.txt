Abstract
This study specifically aims to examine the English proficiency index of 54 countries worldwide and to find if there is a significant correlation between the English proficiency index of a country and some socio-economic technological factors. This study also aims to find if there are other factors that affect the English proficiency index of people which will be of great help for all stakeholders in making the right decisions in English teaching and assessment, and ultimately improve English proficiency index worldwide. Among all factors considered vis-Ã -vis English Proficiency Index, only government expenditure on public education manifests direct positive correlation to the 2012 EPI results of 54 countries under study. In brief, the level of English Proficiency of a country is a by-product of theamount its government invests in education.
