Abstract
Gossipâ€™s unrelenting presence throughout time, age, gender, and social structure has sparked a lot of questions regarding its occurrence. Although studies have already been made regarding gossip, it has remained to be an understudied happening in the area of psychological research. This paper examines gossip from a psychological standpoint, looking into the relationship between a personâ€™s self concept and their propensity to gossip. The theory formulated in this study will explain, describe, and predict the nature of gossip as a projection of basic life issues. As such, this paper gives another perspective into how gossip can be viewed, examined, and understood.
