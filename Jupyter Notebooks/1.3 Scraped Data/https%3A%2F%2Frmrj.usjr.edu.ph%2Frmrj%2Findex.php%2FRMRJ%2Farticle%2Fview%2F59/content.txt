Abstract
The study aims to examine the physical change of the old and new photographs ofselected Cebu City landmarks. The images were converted into a binary image using the simplest form of image processing known as thresholding effect. The binary image provides a simple view and ease for computing its fractal dimension. The fractal dimension explains the space-filling property of the image. The change of the fractal dimension between the old and new image may be attributed to a number of factors such as environmental change, local development agenda and legislative clarity.
