Abstract
This study looks into the patterns found in the musical scores of selected composers in the Classical-Romantic period. Random masterpieces were taken from six (6) composers with five (5) musical compositions from each. The image of each musical score was analyzed to obtain its fractal dimension, with the idea of identifying a signature style of music for each composer. Findings revealed that there was consistency with less variance of the fractal dimensions of musical scores for each composer. Furthermore, the minimal disparity of the fractal dimensions across composers, discloses the common influence of Classical-Romantic era where pieces during this period are mostly homophonic, and capitalize on melody and accompaniment.
