Abstract
This narrative review examined the philosophical bases of research methods interms of: (1) ontology; and (2) epistemology. Three search strategies were observed including: (1) data search for published research; (2) public engine and manual search; and (3) stakeholders input. Subthemes under ontologic assumptions are: (1) singular vs plural reality; (2) empirical vs subjective reality; (3) scientific vs sensuous reality; (4) when the singularity and plurality of reality converge; (5) definitive vs subjective truth; (6) continuum vs polarity; (7) what really is real; (8) truth, reality and knowledge; and (9) seeing the truth and reality of an objective/subjective from different perspective. The focus of the lens is guided by philosophical stances. Each paradigm seeks truth, reality and knowledge. Though quantitative claimed objectivity and qualitative claim subjectivity, both unconsciously observe the same processes. The division is a continuum that delights its deficiencies. This is when divergence converges.
