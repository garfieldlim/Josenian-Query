Abstract
This descriptive-correlational study assesses the level of quality of Catholic education of five Recollect schools in Negros Island as assessed by school personnel and what they had done according to the framework of the Philippine Catholic School Standards (PCSS). Also, it determines whether a significant relationship exists between the demographic profile of the school personnel and their quality assessment in order to test the hypothesis that variation in their age, length of service, school origin and designation influence their respective assessments. Using the PCSS Survey Questionnaire, the data were analyzed using mean, Spearman rho, and chi-square. The findings reveal that the level of quality of Catholic education in Recollect schools exceeds the benchmark. Significant inverse relationship was found between between age and length of service of school personnel and their Catholic education quality assessment. However, no significant relationship was found between school of origin and designation and their quality assessment.
