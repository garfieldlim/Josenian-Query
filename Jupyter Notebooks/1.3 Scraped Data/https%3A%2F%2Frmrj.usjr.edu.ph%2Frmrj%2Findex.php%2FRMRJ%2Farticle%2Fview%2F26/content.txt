Abstract
The contrasting practices of private and public institutions affect individuals motivation to work on the maintenance of its facilities. This paper attempts to develop a model that could predict how many years a facility (private or government) would last based on the given number of assumptions and random data. The study used an experimental design using simulation modeling. Assumptions were formulated to measure different variables. Findings revealed that government facilities tend to deteriorate faster compared to its private counterparts. Government facilities would only last approximately up to six (6) years then reach its critical level. This is due to the assumption that only 40% of government institutions are effective workers. Low percentage of effective workers would translate to less motivation of the worker to pursue any transaction that could possibly help the current state of the facility. On the other hand, more than half of the Private facilities would last more than five years before reaching a critical level. This is due to the assumption that private workers are 20% higher compared to government workers in terms of percentage of effective workers. A highly motivated worker will always be willing to spend time, even extra time, to perform his job. Benign neglect of a less motivated workforce would result to non performance of his assigned task. Therefore, increasing the level of motivation of an employee is the primordial concern of every organization whether private or public because an increase of well motivated and effective workforce would encourage everyone to help maintain and to extend the life of every facility.
