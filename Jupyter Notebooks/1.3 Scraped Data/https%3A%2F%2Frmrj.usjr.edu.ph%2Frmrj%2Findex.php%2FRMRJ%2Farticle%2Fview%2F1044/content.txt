Abstract
English proficiency has been a complex skill to develop in a face-to-face setting, especially in the remote learning modality. This descriptive-correlational study aims to determine the various macro and micro context factors in English language learning of secondary students (n=189) under modular distance learning. Factor analysis is utilized in extracting the following factor loadings for macro-context: a) lack of assistance from more knowledgeable others, b) unconducive-to-learning environment, c) cultural influence, d) poor feedback mechanism, e) insufficient resources, and f) low quality of the self-learning kit. Micro-context factors constitute the following: a) lack of exposure and practice, b) lack of perceived competence, c) lack of motivation and d) lack of interest. Students employed self-regulated strategies and managed to overcome these challenges through a) commitment to practice the skill, b) self-evaluation strategies, and c) social strategies. Studentsâ€™ context should be considered in the teaching and learning process.
