Abstract
Green Chemistry (GC) integration in environmental education has improved understanding of managing pollutants and their impacts. However, the extent of integration in the science curriculum is not widely known in the Philippines. In this convergent mixed-method design, the researchers determined the SHS Chemistry teachersâ€™ (n=30) knowledge, perceptions, GC integration in Chemistry topics, and challenges in teaching Green Chemistry Education (GCE). Complementary quantitative and qualitative results showed valid and reliable findings, claiming that teachers have limited preconceived knowledge on GCE but perceived it as an essential part of the teaching-learning process. Awareness of chemical hazards and their impacts on the environment is often demonstrated but rarely elaborated during discussions in Chemistry classes. Problems encountered in teaching GCE were also identified. A moderate positive correlation between the teachersâ€™ knowledge and their GC perception was observed. However, no significant relationship was found when the teachersâ€™ knowledge and perception were correlated to GC integration.
