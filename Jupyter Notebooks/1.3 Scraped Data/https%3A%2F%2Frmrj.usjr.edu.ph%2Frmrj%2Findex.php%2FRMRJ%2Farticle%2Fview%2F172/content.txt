Abstract
This study is a validation of the varied parameters of global competitiveness level of the ASEAN countries. Government effectiveness (GE) and corruption control (CC) are the direct predictors and independent variables while global competitiveness (GC) is the response variable. The determined causal factors affected by government effectiveness and corruption control are human development (HD) and enabling trade facilitation (ETF) which have varied impacts to global competitiveness. The researcher utilized a path analysis where 6 path models were established from the predictors (x) to its response variable (y) to determine which among these factors creates a huge impact. Path coefficients were generated and the summation of value effects was determined. Findings revealed that government effectiveness and corruption control were substantial elements that influenced the dynamism and vitality of global competitiveness landscape. However, GE has a strong direct effect to GC as compared to CC and from amongst the indirect effects, the correlation between GE and HD relative to GC has the highest path coefficient. The existing economic and political conditions of the individual ASEAN member countries reflected by the implications of the raw data collected are seen as an impediment to a more collective performance. Hence, this study implies a two-fold re-evaluation and strengthening of the policy formulation and implementation individually and collectively as a regional bloc.
