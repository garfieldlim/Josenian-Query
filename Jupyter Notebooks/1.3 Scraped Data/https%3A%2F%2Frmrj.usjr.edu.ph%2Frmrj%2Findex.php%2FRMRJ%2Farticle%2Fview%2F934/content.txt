Abstract
This qualitative research describes the experiences of Filipino graduate students as they continue with their schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Particular challenges faced are related to technology and internet access. As graduate work is expected to be about research tasks, subscribing to paid resources is seen as an issue. It is also crucial to recognize how the experience has caused stress for students. The experienced challenges are resolved by augmenting studentsâ€™ technological capacity, realigning personal values and perspectives, and resorting to free and open access journals to sustain research activities. The COVID-19 experience has taught graduate students the importance of technology, the significance of revisiting oneâ€™s values, and the reflection on their quest to finish their graduate studies. Lastly, assistance to graduate students can be done by proactively offering infrastructure assistance, socio-emotional support, and institutionalizing responsive and flexible communication mechanisms.
