Abstract
The Commission on Higher Education emphasized that extension programs provide the space to discover practical evidence, and science-based answers to real-world social, economic, and environmental challenges for partner communities. This descriptive study looked into the impact of an extension program to address the needs of the day care workers. It employed a questionnaire, unstructured interview, and focus group discussion in gathering the data. The study revealed that the parents and the social workers were responsive to the needs of the day care workers.  Seven themes emerged namely: eliciting parents and childrenâ€™s active involvement, improving collaboration and communication, learning from seminars, availing necessities and learning resources, improving pedagogical competence and practices of DCWs, and improving the learning environment. The extension program helped the day care workers established sustainable and effective day care centers through forging and sustaining strong partnerships with parents, government, and non-government organizations.
