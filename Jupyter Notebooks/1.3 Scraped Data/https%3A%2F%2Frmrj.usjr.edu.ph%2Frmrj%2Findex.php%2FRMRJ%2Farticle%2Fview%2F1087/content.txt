Abstract
The pandemic disrupts the functioning of most sectors and exposes the shortcomings and vulnerabilities among many. Literature search in leading databases reveals that though shocked by the crisis, many industries and organizations have reinvented themselves through various strategies to overcome the consequences of the pandemic. After a thorough analysis of individual articles, the authors found out that human resource management considers the disruptive changes in the working pattern, challenges, and opportunities ahead and makes appropriate changes to create an efficient workforce for the future with the help of technology that has become an inevitable companion in human resource management and not a panacea for uncertainties and crises ahead.
