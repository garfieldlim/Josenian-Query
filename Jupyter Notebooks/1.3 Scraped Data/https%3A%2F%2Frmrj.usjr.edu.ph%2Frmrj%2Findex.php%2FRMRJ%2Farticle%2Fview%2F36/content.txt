Abstract
This study evaluated the burnout levels among college students enrolled in the 3rd year and 4th year. Recognizing the uniqueness and the technical nature of the Bachelor of Science in Accountancy, and seeing that there is a dearth of literature that examined burnout in this particular program, the researchers assessed the burnout levels of 220 accountancy students in the 3rd year and 4th year. The results revealed that about 98% of the entire sample registered a high burnout level in the dimension of reduced personal accomplishment, suggesting that the students feel less empowered and less confident in their academic undertakings. Using the Kruskal â€“ Wallis test, the researchers also noticed that 3rd year students showed a higher level of burnout in the area of emotional exhaustion.There was no significant difference that existed in the burnout dimensions of depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment.
