Abstract
The growth of the number of environmental organizations indicates that peopleconsider the importance of the preservation and conservation of the environment. However, in the ethical point of view, it is important to know the ultimate intention of the people behind these organizations. Were these organizations really created for the sake of the environment or for anthropocentric reasons? This study tries to evaluate through textual analysis three non-government organizations, their vision, and programs. It is found out that although the intentions of the organizations are for the protection of the environment, but ultimately the reasons for the creation of such organizations are always anthropocentric.
