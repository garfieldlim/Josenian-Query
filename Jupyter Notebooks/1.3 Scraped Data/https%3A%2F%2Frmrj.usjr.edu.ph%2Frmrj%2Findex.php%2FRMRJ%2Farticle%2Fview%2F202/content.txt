Abstract
This study aims to resolve the problem on the free cloud storage services. With innumerable providers, data and files are dispersed across multiple cloud repositories. Users try to have multiple accounts on the same cloud storage provider or to sign up for an account from different providers. Hence, Fuse creates an illusion of a larger capacity of data volume that will be made available for free for public consumption. With Fuse, files are consolidated and managed in a sophisticated manner to ensure data preservation and performance efficiency.Â  This centralized cloud service is made to utilize todayâ€™s emerging cloud services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Box. With 1 account, users will be able to store files online and access them anywhere with larger storage capacity than what is available today.
