Vol. 10 No. 1 (2022)
The celebration of the 500 years of Christianity in the Philippines was both a milestone and a challenge.  Like a kilometer post that indicates where we are in our journey and how far we have to go yet, the celebration compels Filipinos to look back and embrace the future ahead.
The 10.1 Issue of the RMRJ will also bring us to a "looking back" of humanity's existence with the article " Timeless Existence and Principle of Creation: Notions Embedded in John 1:1, â€œIn the Beginning Was the Word." The journal also looks into the collective and individual experiences during the pandemic that gave birth to the articles: "Modeling Employee Retention Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic: An Econometric Approach", " Paternal Resilience in Time of Pandemic: A Phenomenological Inquiry on the Experiences of Fathers of Children with Autism" and "Understanding the Suicide Phenomenon from the Perspectives of the Loss Survivors."
The present is the most solid anchor for any "looking back" activity.  Hence, the issue includes concerns like the "Ratooning Response of Lowland Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Var. PSB Rc22 to Production Management Practices" "Construction of Difference Sets from Unions of Cyclotomic Classes of Order N=14", "The Properties of Interlocking Directorates in the Philippines: An Exploratory Analysis," and "An Inquiry into the Problems Concerning Filipino Values and Norms."
Daily activities and processes become the point of reflection and investigation like the articles "The Infusion of Folk Catholicism to Tambal Binisaya as an Indigenous Healing System in Iligan City," "Correlating the Psychological and Spiritual Well-Being of Junior High School Students in Selected Catholic Schools in Central Philippines," "The Yapian Classification of the Vocabulary of the Austronesian Visayan-Cebuano Language," "Development of Science Research Culture in Basic Education: A Theory Generation," "Cognitive Dimension of Learning Using Garden-Based Education towards Sustainability: A Meta-Synthesis," and "The Community of Inquiry Instructional Strategies Impact on Student Satisfaction on Remote Learning."
May this issue of the RMRJ be the readers' companion in their pursuit of answers for further inquiry and deeper reflection.
Adelante!
