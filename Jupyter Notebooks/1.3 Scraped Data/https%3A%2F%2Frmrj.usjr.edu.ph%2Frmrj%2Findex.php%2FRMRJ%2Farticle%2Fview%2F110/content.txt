Abstract
The Asian economy has been continuously growing since the beginning of the 21st century. Asian countries are starting to carve their names in the A-list of the growing world economy. Considering the stability of its excellent performance in a continual growth, the researchers endeavored to find out whether what a countryâ€™s economic growth is reflected in the level of satisfaction of its citizens.Using exploratory data analysis, indices pertinent relating to general perception, social trust, security, government performance, and professional relations were calculated. Results showed that countries which are generally perceived to be not doing well in terms of economy seem to exhibit a higher level of satisfaction from its citizens.
