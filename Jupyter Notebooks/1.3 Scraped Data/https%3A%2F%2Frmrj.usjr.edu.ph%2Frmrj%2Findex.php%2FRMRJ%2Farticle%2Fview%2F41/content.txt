Abstract
Recognizing the peculiar nature of college degrees, this paper endeavoredto examine student engagement in a sample of 859 college students enrolled in the degree Bachelor of Science in Accountancy. Using the Student Engagement Instrument (Anderson, 2006) and employing a descriptive design, the researchers examined student engagement in the subscales of Teacher Student Relationship, Peer Support for Learning, Family Support for Learning, Control and Relevance of Schoolwork, Future Goals and Aspirations, and Extrinsic Motivation. The results showed that, for highly technical courses like the Bachelor of Science in Accountancy, the subscale on Teacher Student Relationship registered the lowest number and percentage of engaged students. Consequently, the only subscale which registered significant difference among means is Control and Relevance of Schoolwork. The post hoc test using Tukeyâ€™s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) further revealed that the significant differences for this subscale are registered between students in the 1st, 3rd and 4th years, and students in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years.
