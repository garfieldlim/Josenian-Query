Abstract
This study mirrors the symbolic actions of cultural characters in Davao folk narratives. It utilized descriptive-narrative and narrative-conversational methods to collect and analyze the folk narratives in the Davao region. The Cultural Symbolism theory of Clifford Geertz was used to reveal the interweaving culture of the indigenous people. Thus, the symbolic actions present in the texts are the following: pangayaw (tribal war), divine intervention, hunting, trading, belief in the existence of heaven, usage of magical instruments, cursing and casting enchantments, and patronizing a Datu. Hence, this study contributes to the preservation of culture which is slowly vanishing due to the effects of colonization, modernization, and globalization. Thus, further studies on myths, folktales, folk songs, folk speeches, and folk epics should be done to promote the cultural awareness among postmodern Filipinos.
