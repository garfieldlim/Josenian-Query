Abstract
The study analyzes the fractal image of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies that were taken from the Pacific Ocean and relates this to the tropical depressions and cyclones in the Pacific basin. Previous studies indicate a significant statistical correlation between tropical cyclone power dissipation and SSTs, although it is not clear on what aspect of SSTs affects the cyclone forming. SSTs are calculated from infrared pictures that the polar-orbitingsatellites take twice a week around the globe. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, defines anomalies in SST against a long-term mean SST. A positive anomaly means that the current SST is warmer than average, and a negative anomaly means it is cooler than mean SST. This study reveals that the high fractal dimensions of the upper range of the SST anomaly and the low mean barometric pressure on the cyclone basin closely correlates to the frequency and intensity of tropical depressions and tropical cyclones.
