Abstract
Let G = (V(G),E(G)) be a simple connected graph. A dominating set S in G is called a secure dominating set in G if for every u âˆˆ V (G) \ S, there exists v âˆˆ S âˆ© NG(u) such that (S \ {v}) âˆª {u} is a dominating set. The minimum cardinality of secure dominating set is called the secure domination number of G and is denoted by Î³s(G). A secure dominating set of cardinality Î³s(G) is called Î³s-set of G. Let D be a minimum secure dominating set in G. The secure dominating set Â Â SâŠ† V(G)\D is called an inverse secure dominating set with respect to D. The inverse secure domination number of G denoted by Î³sâˆ’1(G) is the minimum cardinality of an inverse secure dominating set in G. An inverse secure dominating set of cardinality Î³sâˆ’1(G) is called Î³sâˆ’1-set. A disjoint secure dominating set in G is the set C = D âˆª S âŠ† V(G). The disjoint secure domination number of G denoted by Î³Î³r(G) is the minimum cardinality of a disjoint secure dominating set in G. A disjoint secure dominating set of cardinality Î³Î³s(G) is called Î³Î³s-set. In this paper, we show that every integers k and n with k âˆˆ {2, 4, 5, ...n âˆ’ 1, n} is realizable as disjoint secure domination number, and order of G respectively. Further, we give the characterization of the disjoint secure dominating set in the join of two graphs.
