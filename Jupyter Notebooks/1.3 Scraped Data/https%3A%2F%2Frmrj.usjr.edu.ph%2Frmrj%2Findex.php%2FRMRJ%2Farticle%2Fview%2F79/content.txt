Abstract
Both national and transnational parameters of tourism need to be placed in proper perspectives. This paper surveys past economic and environmental parameters, presents updated empirical findings and conveys the relation of tourism income to the economic factors: gross domestic products, consumer price index, inflation rates, exchange rates and employment rate with emphasis on the effect of weather disturbances to the number of tourist arrival. The strategic interactions among these indicators have to be considered by the government in the formulation and implementation of a broad range of national strategic policy measures towards the development of countryâ€™s competitiveness by optimizing the gains of tourism which plays an important role in identifying novel policy recommendations and pattern insights. This study seeks to analyze the parameters of tourism as one of the major drivers of economic growth.
