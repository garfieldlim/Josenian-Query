Abstract
This study developed a geographic information system (GIS)-based decision support system in the spatial identification of a viable location for shallow tube-well irrigation development in the province of Isabela. Factors such as slope, soil type; land cover and groundwater depth were used as input parameters. Around 98% of the existing shallow tube-wells were within the suitable area. The developed map was validated using existing irrigated areas. Results show that more than 377,000 hectares were found potentially suitable locations for shallow tube-well irrigation development. These areas are characterized with a water table depth of <6.5 m, a slope of<18%, soil textures (sandy loam, clay loam, and sandy clay). Sufficient factors in combination with the GIS tool is a great tool to carry out spatial data in land-use analysis and the use of this as a means in identifying viable locations for shallow tube-well irrigation development in other places is reliable.
