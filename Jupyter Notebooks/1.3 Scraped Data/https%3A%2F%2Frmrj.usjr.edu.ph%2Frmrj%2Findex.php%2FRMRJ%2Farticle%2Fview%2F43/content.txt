Abstract
The study compares the fractal dimensions of the board examination percentage scores for nursing graduates in June 2012 and December 2012. The purpose of such a comparison is to assess the ruggedness or roughness of the scores over the two assessment periods. The more rugged the scores viz. higher fractal dimensions, implies the variability of the studentsâ€™ performance. Results revealed that the June, 2012 test scores have higher fractal dimension than the December, 2012 test scores. The paper concludes that students behavior pertinent to the assessment varies in June than December PNLE. This is in contrast to the usual notion that it is with test difficulty where disparity of performance takes place. The author deduced some observations minimizing such disparity.
