Abstract
This paper exposes the pseudoscientific characteristic as well the moral issue of traditional and alternative medicines in the Philippines by employing textual analysis of literature published about the nature of traditional and alternative medicine and the distinctions of science from pseudoscience anchored primarily on Karl Popperâ€™s falsifiability theory. Â Specifically, â€˜How traditional and alternative medicines are perceived and received by Filipinos?â€™ and â€˜What are the underlying moral issues regarding the pseudoscientific characteristic of traditional and alternative medicines?â€™Discussions like these are necessary in order to identify how traditional and alternative medicine information is communicated through product advertising, practices and the media, which is significant for consumers in making right decisions.
