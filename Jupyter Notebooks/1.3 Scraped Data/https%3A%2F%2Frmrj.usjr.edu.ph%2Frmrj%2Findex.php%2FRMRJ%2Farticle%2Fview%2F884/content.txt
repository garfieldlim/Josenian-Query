Abstract
The Philippinesâ€™ location within the Pacific Ring of Fire brings enormous threat to its people. Intervention and innovation are to be in place for survival and growth, since nothing can be done about its geographic location and the threats that come with it. This study aims to create a framework for developing a decision support system, a mobile and web application for the efficient implementation of the disaster logistics support system. The study will utilize Agile Methodology for the software development in the proposed framework. This proposed framework exhibits the features of the system such as identifying location, affected families, supplies, reports, management of inventory, vehicle outsourcing, and monitoring. The system framework can be a helpful tool for the efficient and speedy delivery of needed help and an effective approach to disaster supply chain issues.
