Abstract
There is no known study made about the Anglo-American ideas found in JoseRizalâ€™s poems. Hence, this study looks into Rizalâ€™s poem Education gives luster to the motherland and identify the Anglo-American ideas that are found in it. The study assumed that since England and the United States are politically and economically powerful, they have great influence to states that are less powerful like the Philippines. The study found out through descriptive textual analysis that Rizalâ€™s poem is romanticist in character. Since romanticism originated in England, his poem contains English ideas and he is influencedby English thought. Rizal is a proponent of education as shown by the poem. His advocacy for education as a means by which the nation can develop is shared by the Americans because education is one of the major contributions and legacy of America to Philippine history. Rizalâ€™s desire to liberate his countrymen from ignorance which in turn will liberate the people from oppression is parallel to Americaâ€™s advocacy for liberation, freedom and democracy. Therefore, Rizalâ€™s poem contains American ideas and he is influenced by American thought. This study recommends that another analysis must be made to see if Rizalâ€™s other poems contain Anglo-American ideas.
