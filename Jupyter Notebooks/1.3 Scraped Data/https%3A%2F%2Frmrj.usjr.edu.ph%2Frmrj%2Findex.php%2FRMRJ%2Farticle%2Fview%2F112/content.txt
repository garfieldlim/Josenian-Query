Abstract
The Philippines has been inundated with socio-politico issues that impede peopleâ€™s desire for the countryâ€™s uninterrupted progress. These issues may be complex but their antidote is contrarily simple. An answer is found in Immanuel Kantâ€™s thought on moral culture which pertains to three essential features, namely: obedience, truthfulness, and sociableness. This qualitative research focuses on the fundamental ideas in the section on moral culture in Kantâ€™s On Education. As my contribution to the fund of knowledge, I proceed by establishing the implications and antitheses of the three features of Kantâ€™s moral culture. A discussion on obedience differentiates its two kinds: absolute and voluntary. Absolute obedience is the result of compulsion by a command, while voluntary obedience is the result of confidence by a reasonable will. It is impossible to think of character formation without also thinking of truthfulness. Kant asserts that a man who tells lies has no character. Sociableness emphasizes on the importance of building relationships and friendships. The researcher contends that these three features of moral culture have corresponding antitheses: violation of laws of the land for obedience; lying and dishonesty (highest form is corruption in politics) for truthfulness; and human rights violation (highest form is war) for sociableness. Finally, these features are imperative in forging peace and social order which usher to a kind of development that people aspire.
