Abstract
This study aims to draw insights and implications on conflict management strategies from selected philosophers. It utilizes textual or content analysis to present and explain what they have to say and offer about conflict management strategies. The study shows that different philosophers have varied approaches and strategies to conflict management among them are yielding, compromising, collaborating, competing, and avoiding. However, they share commonalities such as the discernment and defense of the greater good/common good over individual interests and desires; the discernment and defense of truth, rectitude, and justice over beliefs, feelings, opinions, prejudices, injustice and stereotypes; the principle of not harming others; a preventive approach to conflict management rather than curative. Therefore, philosophy is not somethingabstract but offers practical strategies to manage conflict. The study is relevant because it is an additional literature on conflict management particularly from the perspective of philosophy considering that there is dearth in the literature. This study recommends that another study be made using different set of philosophers. Also, one may look into leadership or management styles reflected in the philosophy of selected philosophers.
