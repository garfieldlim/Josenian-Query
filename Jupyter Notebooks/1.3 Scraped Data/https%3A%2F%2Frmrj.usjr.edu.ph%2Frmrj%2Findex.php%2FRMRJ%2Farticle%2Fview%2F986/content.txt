Abstract
St. Johnâ€™s Gospel begins with a prologue, serving as an overture to the whole Gospel. This paper investigates the philosophical notions embedded in the first three lines of John 1:1. The inquiry focuses on whether or not the accepted meaning of this line as â€œindicating timeless existenceâ€ can be deduced from John 1:1 and whether or not John 1:1 also indicates the meaning of the â€œprinciple of creation.â€ This paper proceeds to make this inquiry in the following order: Introduction; The questions arising in John 1:1; Word as God is eternal, outside time; â€œIn the beginningâ€ as predicate; â€œThe Word was in the beginningâ€; Timeless existence and the verb was; The Word as God is a principle of creation (which included the distinction between the concepts of anthropological intentionality and metaphysical intentionality); and Conclusion. This paper concludes by affirming the two questions on timeless existence and the principle of creation.
