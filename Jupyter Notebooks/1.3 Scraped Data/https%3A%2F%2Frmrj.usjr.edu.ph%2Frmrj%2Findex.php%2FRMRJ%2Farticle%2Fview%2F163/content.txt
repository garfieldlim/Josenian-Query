Abstract
Let G be a connected simple graph. A nonempty subset S of the vertex set V (G) is a clique in G if the graph <S> induced by S is complete. A clique S in G is a clique dominating set if it is a dominating set. Let C be a minimum clique dominating set in G. The clique dominating setÂ Â Â  SâŠ†V(G)\C is called an inverse clique dominating set with respect to C. The minimum cardinality of inverse clique dominating set is called an inverse clique domination number of G and is denoted by Î³cl âˆ’1 (G). An inverse clique dominating set of cardinality Î³cl âˆ’1(G) is called Î³cl âˆ’1-set of G. In this paper we investigate the concept and give some important results.
