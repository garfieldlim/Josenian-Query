"Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards. Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.

SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard

Two years into the pandemic and stories abound establishments closing, companies downsizing, individuals embracing virtual spaces, transactions migrating to online platforms, and more. To quote the philosopher Kierkegaard, â€œLife must be lived forwardâ€, and moving forward means getting up, rebuilding from the remnants of pandemic.  For, after all, the subject of life is living, and to live is to be in the present moment and respond to the realities we experience.

In this issue of the RMRJ, we continue to rise up, rebuild, and further the discussion in the field of Education, with the papers: Feynman Technique as a Heutagogical Learning Strategy for Independent and Remote Learning, Green Chemistry Education among Senior High School Chemistry Teachers: Knowledge, Perceptions, and Level of Integration, and Macro and Micro Context Factors in English Language Learning in Modular Distance Learning.

In Math and Engineering, we shall learn more On the Generators of the Group of Units Modulo a Prime and Its Analytic and Probabilistic Views, Approximate Analytic Solution to the Three Species Lotka â€“ Volterra Differential Equation Model, and Rice Machinery Requirement in La Union, Philippines: A Basis for Prioritizing Deployment.

While in Philosophy and Religion, we will have Visayan Philosophy of Labor: A Reflection from the Notion of Kahimtang and John Paul IIâ€™s Philosophy, and lastly, for Business and Economics, a glimpse into the Challenges and Opportunities in Philippine Tourism amid the COVID-19 Pandemic, Food Safety Compliance, and Challenges of Micro Food Business Operators: Implications to COVID-19 Pandemic, Human Resource Management: Pre-pandemic, Pandemic and Beyond.

We wish you an enjoyable and insightful reading ahead and an advance Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!","Professor NILO T. BUGTAI, Ph.D.
