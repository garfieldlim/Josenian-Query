It is with great pride and joy to invite you to read the latest issue of the Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal (RMRJ). Before moving forward, I would like to have this opportunity to thank our readers, our contributors and researchers, and our editorial board for their time and effort that had gone into the development of this issue.

As we look at the RMRJ, it represents innovation and the collective thinking of a group to satisfy the thirst and hunger for knowledge. It is a known fact that part of human nature is its curiosity and naturally intrigued.

The RMRJ seeks to be the leader in promoting multidisciplinary research. It believes that multidisciplinary research shall be the gold standard of the entire scientific paradigm. It encourages different researchers from different fields to form and engage in solving different, complex scientific problems, innovating to improve our lives, and understanding human nature. At our time right now, there has been an increase undertaking of multiple disciplines being discussed under a single subject, increasing the need for us to engage in multidisciplinary studies.

We want RMRJ as one of the forefront journals that would make a great difference and impact on the academic community. That is why it is one of our next goals in the future to be indexed under SCOPUS. We would do our best to make sure we achieve that goal and keep being an avenue of multidisciplinary research.",NA,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.02,2019-12-31,https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/issue/view/25
