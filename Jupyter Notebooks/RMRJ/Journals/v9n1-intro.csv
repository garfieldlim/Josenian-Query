"The subject of life is living. Hence, to live means to move forward.  COVID-19 challenged this and brought most businesses deemed as non-essentials, the schools, and activities like traveling to a standstill. It brought. Volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) to humanity. To live, then, the human being has to rise from these challenges and get back to the race called life.

The 9.1 issue of the RMRJ centers on the theme RESILIENCY IN THE NEW NORMAL.  Five articles, namely: ""Extended Technology Acceptance Model to Examine the Use of Google Forms â€“ based Lesson Playlist amidst COVID-19 Pandemic"", ""Remote learning readiness and challenges: Experiences among tertiary state university Management Students,"" ""The Philippine K to 12 Program in Thematic Instruction"", ""The Market Distortion Effect of State Intervention in Higher Education,"" and the ""Factors Affecting the Teachers' Resiliency Amidst the Covid-19 "" explore how resiliency is exhibited in the field of education and how education can be more responsive to the present situation.

Research and development in the field of Engineering and Technology will be essayed in ""A computer vision application for measuring deflection in two-dimensional view of reinforced concrete beams,"" ""Performance Evaluation of Rice Hull-Fueled Cabinet Food Dryer,"" ""A Sound-based Machine Learning to Predict Traffic Vehicle Density,"" ""Sequential Pattern Mining of Tourist Spatiotemporal Movement Patterns,"" and ""Utilization of Wastewater from Different Sources as a Potential Sources of Electrical Energy.""

In the article,"" Mortality Analysis of Early COVID-19 Cases in the Philippines Based on Observed Demographic and Clinical Characteristics"", the disease that restricted and affected the whole world will be brought to light again to understand it further.

The challenge of moving forward will also be responded to in the Math papers that tackle ""Angle Trisection, Bhaskara's Proof, and Pythagorean Theorem"" and the 'Uniform Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator of Fractal Dimension.""

May you be helped by this June 2021 (9.1) issue of the RMRJ in one way or the other and encourage resiliency in others, too.
