"Timeless Existence and Principle of Creation: Notions Embedded in John 1:1, ""In the Beginning Was the Word""","John 1:1, Word, beginning, timeless existence, principle of creation, intentionality",Emiliano C. De Catalina,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.01,"St. John's Gospel begins with a prologue, serving as an overture to the whole Gospel. This paper investigates the philosophical notions embedded in the first three lines of John 1:1. The inquiry focuses on whether or not the accepted meaning of this line as ""indicating timeless existence"" can be deduced from John 1:1 and whether or not John 1:1 also indicates the meaning of the ""principle of creation."" This paper proceeds to make this inquiry in the following order: Introduction; The questions arising in John 1:1; Word as God is eternal, outside time; ""In the beginning"" as predicate; ""The Word was in the beginning""; Timeless existence and the verb was; The Word as God is a principle of creation (which included the distinction between the concepts of anthropological intentionality and metaphysical intentionality); and Conclusion. This paper concludes by affirming the two questions on timeless existence and the principle of creation.","Alvira, T., Clavell, L., & Melendo, T. (1991).

Ratooning Response of Lowland Rice (Oryza sativa L.) var. PSB Rc22 to Production Management Practices,"approach, gross margin, lowland rice, management, ratooning","Dionesio M. BaÅˆoc, Victor B. Asio",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.08,"This study aimed to determine the ratooning ability of lowland rice to production management practices. It assessed the profitability of rice ratooning to the abovementioned objectives. The experiment was set out in a split-plot organized in a Randomized Complete Block Design with production management practices as the main plot and cutting heights of ratoon crop as the subplot treatment. Production management practices notably affected all agronomic characteristics, yield, and yield component parameters evaluated except the grain yield. Cutting height remarkably influenced all growth and yield parameters tested except panicle weight. Economic analysis revealed that the improved method achieved a higher gross margin (PHP21,321.60) than the farmerâ€™s practice (PHP15,419.40) because of the formerâ€™s high productivity (1.64 t ha-1). A cutting height of 45.0 cm under the improved method obtained the highest gross margin (PHP28,677.00). Moreso, this approach is considered a good measure in adapting to the problematic scenario relative to climate change.","Asio, V. B. (1996).

Paternal Resilience in Time of Pandemic: A Phenomenological Inquiry on the Experiences of Fathers of Children with Autism,"Special Education, fathers of children with autism, COVID-19 pandemic, phenomenology, Philippines","Sarah Therese P. Jardenil, Dennis V. Madrigal",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.02,"This phenomenological research was conducted to inquire into the experiences of fathers of children with autism during the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study was explored because there is a dearth of studies focusing on paternal involvement and a lack of local autism research. Nine participants, who were chosen using purposive sampling, individually participated in an unstructured interview. The van Kaam method popularized by Moustakas was used to analyze the data gathered. Five major themes emerged: recognizing the child's needs, surviving hardships, enduring exhaustion, encountering silver linings, and moving forward. The findings showed that fathers of children with autism encountered challenging and fulfilling events during the pandemic with resilience. Fathers of children with autism prioritized familial needs, especially of the child, and increased their presence in the household. A strong paternal character builds up fathersâ€™ resilience in coping with the difficulties of raising a child with autism in a precarious time.","Alhuzimi, T. (2021).

An Inquiry into the Problems Concerning Filipino Values and Norms,"Filipino, values, norms, validity, efficacy, problems",Jiolito L. Benitez,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.03,"This paper inquires into the problems concerning Filipino values and moral norms. Based on the interviews with the social science and philosophy scholars and the youth leaders in the Philippines, the study identifies the following problems: Filipino identity, distortion and dysfunctionalization, manifold ambivalence, dissonance, false justification and misuse, cynicism, and decline of moral courage. Analyzed based on Hans Kelsenâ€™s concept of validity and efficacy, the problems prove to be radical given that the purported Filipino values system is actually a chaotic constellation of competing and conflicting pre-colonial, colonial, and postcolonial normative paradigms. Distorted, ambivalent, and dysfunctionalized, Filipino values and norms fail to provide effective normative guidelines. The proposed antidote of moral and values education is bound to be futile in the face of a severely mutilated social conscience.","Aguas, J. J. S. (2016).

Correlating the Psychological and Spiritual Well-Being of Junior High School Students in Selected Catholic Schools in Central Philippines,"Psychology, psycho-spiritual well-being, junior high school students, Philippines","Chris Feli Joy P. Tajonera, Dennis V. Madrigal",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.05,"This descriptive-correlational study assesses the psycho-spiritual well-being of junior high school students at Catholic Schools in Central Philippines. Also, it determines the relationship between the said constructs, and at the same, their association between the variables of sex, family structure, birth order, religious affiliation, and church involvement. The data are gathered using Ryffâ€™s Psychological Well-being and Ellison and Paloutzianâ€™s Spiritual Well-being Scale. The findings reveal moderate levels of psychological and spiritual well-being among the respondents. Point biserial shows that a significant relationship existed between the demographics of family structure and psychological well-being and between church involvement and psychological well-being. Rank biserial shows, on the other hand, that there is a significant relationship between family structure and spiritual well-being and between church involvement and spiritual well-being. Also, Spearman Rank Correlation results indicated that there is a relationship between psychological well-being and spiritual well-being.","Ahmadpoori, S. F., & Motaghi, M. (2020).

Construction of Difference Sets from Unions of Cyclotomic Classes of Order N=14,"difference set, cyclotomic class, union, computer search",Benedict M. Estrella,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.04,"Let G be an additive group of order v, D be a non-empty proper k-subset of G, and λ be any integer. Then D is a (v, k, λ) - difference set if every nonzero element of the group can be expressed as a difference d1 - d2 of elements of D in exactly λ ways. Let q be a prime of the form q = nN + 1 for integers n>1 and N>1. For q<1000, this study shows the construction of difference sets in the additive group of the field GF(q) from unions of cyclotomic classes of order N = 14 using a computer search. The construction consisted of computer programs derived from the definitions and theorems on difference sets using Python. The results revealed that only the union of seven cyclotomic classes such as C0(14, q) U C2(14, q) U C4(14, q) U C6(14, q) U C8(14, q) U C10(14, q) U C12(14, q) forms a quadratic cyclotomic difference set. Similarly, this union together with zero forms a difference set equivalent to the modified quadratic cyclotomic difference sets.","Balmaceda, J. M. P., & Estrella, B. M. (2021).

The Properties of Interlocking Directorates in the Philippines: An Exploratory Analysis,"Board interlock, interlocking directorate, network analysis, Philippines, centrality",Stevenson Q. Yu,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.06,"Governance has become an increasingly important factor in the investment decisions of firms and investors. Thus, it is important to determine the quality and composition of corporate boards, which are vital overseers who act in the best interests of shareholders to improve and strengthen them. While interlocking directorates are not a recent occurrence in the Philippines, updated literature on the structure of the countryâ€™s board interlock network is sparse. Thus, this study provides a baseline snapshot by analyzing all 251 publicly-listed companies on the Philippine Stock Exchange at the director and board levels. More so, the study utilizes social network analysis tools to describe the properties of interlocking directorates and visually maps out the social network that underpins these relationships. It reveals that the board network is extensive, with almost 90% of firms connected, thanks to a handful of key directors who have high degrees of connectivity.","Adams, R. B., Hermalin, B.

The Infusion of Folk Catholicism to Tambal Binisaya as an Indigenous Healing System in Iligan City,"folk Christianity, folk religion, folk healing, indigenous knowledge, Catholicism","Lourd Greggory D. Crisol, Efren Jone J. Oledan",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.07,"For generations, folk medicines have been used to cure various diseases with supernatural and naturalistic causations. With ethnographic descriptive design, mananambals, Tambal Binisaya vendors, and loyal patrons served as key informants in this qualitative study. In obtaining the data, observations, field notes, and interviews were the main instruments used to investigate inculturation, which is the underlying phenomenon behind the folk Catholicism evident in Tambal Binisaya. As such, it was revealed that there are strong pieces of evidence of pre-Christian practices in Tambal Binisaya, such as belief in abyans, balance in natural elements in the body, and even animism, which are somehow divergent from Catholic beliefs that put a premium on God and the total healing of the mind, body, and spirit. Despite these differences, Tambal Binisaya somehow integrated these aspects of the two systems into a hybrid healing practice. The indigenous have indeed been married to Catholicism in Tambal Binisaya.","Berdon, Z. J., Ragosta, E.L., Inocian, R.B., Manalag, C.A., & Lozano, E.B. (2016).

Modeling Employee Retention Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic: An Econometric Approach,"employee retention, econometric modeling, COVID-19 pandemic, Baybay City","Dennis T. Caredo, Argina M. Pomida, Angelita L. Paradero, Leomarich F. Casinillo",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.09,"Employee retention is one of the human resource management (HRM) issues. This study determines the factors that significantly influence employee retention amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The study employs complete enumeration and uses primary data. After which, the results are analyzed using descriptive statistics and econometric modeling. Results reveal that employees are satisfied to do their respective jobs (M=4.09, SD=0.48). In addition, they show that the determinants such as other income (p-value=0.024), length of service (p-value=0.099), as well as reward and recognition (p-value=0.015), are significant influences to employeesâ€™ retention. Hence, these conclude that better remuneration (and the increase thereof) are more likely to retain existing employees and attract employees from other organizations. Furthermore, the study specifically recommends that employee retention be improved by further refining reward and recognition that surely meet the needs and well-being of the employees.","Agustiningsih, H.

Sanchez,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.10,"Science research culture in basic education can be associated with science investigatory projects (SIPs). In relation to this, the paper establishes a theory on the development of SIP culture in basic education utilizing theory generation through axiomatic deductive approach based on steps prescribed by R. Padua (personal communication, November 17, 2014) which creates the theory that basic education institutions contribute to high productivity in SIPs. Simply because humans and non-human resources along with quality Science instruction are needed to yield such productivity. These attributes, resources, and Science instruction foster SIP culture. These are crucial aspects as schools capacitate students and teachers, produce the SIPs, and eventually disseminate these projects in science fairs.","Adriano, JD. (2014).

Cognitive Dimension of Learning Using Garden-Based Education towards Sustainability: A Meta-Synthesis,"Garden-based education, curricular integration, Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), Meta-synthesis","Jennifer D. PaÃ±o, Jeralden R. Jumao-as, Marchee T. Picardal",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.11,"Garden-based education (GBE) is an innovative approach to enhancing learnersâ€™ academic performance. However, the mechanism of how it develops the cognitive domain of learning is unclear. This meta-synthesis of 22 published articles focusing on garden-based education integration in the educative process examined its impact on mental aspects of learning. Secondary data from each reviewed article were extracted and analyzed thematically. Five themes emerged describing the impact of GBE on the cognitive domain of learning, namely, 1) experiential learning, 2) meaningful learning, 3) explicit and implicit learning, 4) discovery learning, and 5) transmissible learning. GBE is a successful program in most of the basic education curriculum integration contributing to the improvement of academic performance. Albeit, there is no standard template for its implementation as it varies across context and educational system, adopting the general principle of school garden learning in the teaching and learning process is beneficial for sustainable learning outcomes.","Acharya, K.

The Yapian Classification of the Vocabulary of the Austronesian Visayan-Cebuano Language,"Visayan-Cebuano linguistics, classification of vocabulary, English eight-parts-of-speech, Yapian classification","Joanna Z. De Catalina, Emiliano C. De Catalina",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.12,"After the 1898 Philippine revolution, the English language was introduced in the country by the Americans and it began to surmount in the consciousness of the Filipino people. For one century now, this language has become dominant in the Filipino consciousness. Linguistically, it has even influenced the classification of the vocabulary of the Visayan-Cebuano language, i.e., according to the English eight parts of speech. But, as early as 1947, Manuel Yap, bishop and biblical scholar from Carcar, Cebu, objected, saying that the Visayan-Cebuano vocabulary does not fit in the English eight-parts-of-speech classification. This study, then, aims at inquiring into Yapâ€™s own classification of the Visayan-Cebuano vocabulary. In doing this, it uses the descriptive-analysis research design. First, it presents the English eight-parts-of-speech classification, and second, Yapâ€™s classification of the Visayan-Cebuano vocabulary. It concludes that Yapâ€™s classification is the one that fits to the nature of the Visayan-Cebuano vocabulary.","Agoncillio, T. A. (1990). History of the Filipino people (8th ed.).

Understanding the Suicide Phenomenon from the Perspectives of the Loss Survivors,"suicide, survivors, bereavement, psychosocial, intervention, debriefing",Randy E. Pederi,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.13,"The study is descriptive qualitative research that illustrates the circumstances and new dynamics contributing to the never-ending suicide occurrences. It described first-hand real-life experiences of the suicide-loss survivors to determine the contexts, reasons, and implications of suicide and recommend community-based intervention strategies. Purposive-criterion and convenient sampling methods were used to determine the respondents. Focused group discussion and in-depth interviews were conducted to gather data analyzed using Braun & Clarkeâ€™s six-phase guide. The findings revealed that the life experiences of the respondents are characterized by regret, pain, and bereavement. Suicides were committed due to dysfunctional families, economic hardships, breakdown of relationships, and drug abuse. The pain of suicide affected both the victim and their survivors and occurs within the psychosocial sphere. Interventions should therefore employ a familial, communitarian, and inter-institutional approach. Local Government Units (LGUs) are recommended to initiate a reach-out community-based suicide intervention program and debriefing services.","Adrian, M., McCauley, E., Berk, M. S., Asarnow, J.

The Community of Inquiry Instructional Strategies Impact on Student Satisfaction on Remote Learning,"remote learning, online learning, Community of Inquiry (CoI), course design, instructional strategies, perceived learning, student satisfaction",Mary Gretchen F. Chaves,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.14,"The COVID-19 restrictions compelled institutions worldwide to transition into the remote teaching-learning modality abruptly. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of remote teaching and learning strategies are scant. With the recent shift to this new learning mode, little is known about the fulfillment of learning outcomes and student satisfaction. This research examines the impact of the teaching-learning course design and instructional strategies as implemented by this faculty researcher last school year 2020-2021. It intends to provide practical guidance for teachers aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of their remote teaching/strategies. The research is both quantitative (causal) and qualitative design. A total of 104 management students from a Philippine state university participated in an online survey. The quantitative investigation assessed the influence of the independent variables â€“ the Community of Inquiry (CoI) presence strategies, course design, and instructional strategies on studentsâ€™ perceived learning and satisfaction, utilizing the CoI framework and adopting scales from online teaching.","Arbaugh, J.
