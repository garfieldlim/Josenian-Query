"Angle Trisection, Bhaskaraâ€™s Proof, and Pythagorean Theorem","right angle, angle trisection, Bhaskaraâ€™s first proof, Pythagorean theorem",Emiliano C. De Catalina,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.01.01,"This paper deals with 1) angle trisection, 2) Bhaskaraâ€™s first proof, and 3) Pythagorean theorem. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, to show a new, direct method of trisecting the 900 angle using unmarked straight edge and compass; secondly, to show Bhaskaraâ€™s first proof of the Pythagorean theorem (c2 = a2 + b2) as embedded in this new, direct trisection of the 900 angle; lastly, to show the derivation of the Pythagorean theorem from this trisection of the 900 angle. This paper employs the direct dissection method. It concludes by presenting four points: a) the concept of trisectability as distinct from concept of constructability; b) the trisection of the 900 angle as really a new, different method; c) Bhaskaraâ€™s first proof of the Pythagorean theorem as truly embedded in this trisection of the 900 angle and; d) another way of deriving Pythagorean theorem from this trisection of the 900 angle.","Bailey, D.

A Computer Vision Application for Measuring the Deflection in a Two-dimensional View of Reinforced Concrete Beams,"beam deflection, computer vision, dial gauge, structural member, reinforced concrete, reaction framework","Eduardo Jr. Piedad, Barne Roxette Carpio, Kristine Sanchez, Marven Jabian",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.01.02,"A novel computer vision application is developed to measure the deflection of two-dimensional (2D) reinforced concrete structural members. Eight beam samples, with dimensions of 160 mm x 150 mm x 1400 mm are loaded and simulated under a four-point loading test until failure using a reaction framework machine. A camera is fixed at the center front view of the concrete beams to capture the deflection of the samples while testing. In each test, a dial indicator is installed and the maximum deflection is manually recorded. Based on the results, the maximum deflection values recorded by the proposed application obtained an average error of 18.38 % when compared to the manual measured results. This indicates that computer vision-based application can provide a beam-wide scale deflection performance, compared to the traditional point-based deflection reading. This study paves a new possibility of aiding manual measurements of concrete beams and all other structural studies.","American Society for Testing and Materials, International. (2001).

The three wastewater samples used were from a pond, an abaca pulp mill, and rice fields. Results showed that one of the abaca pulp mill treatments, using carbon rod electrodes with salt bridge presence, reached the highest mean voltage and current to 578.7 mV and 0.2022 mV, respectively. The study revealed that the number of sensible power generation days, from start to end of experimentation, has a significant difference between treatments. Throughout the 20-day fermentation process, a total count of 8.94x105 colony forming units (CFU) per ml was found and purified from the biofilm anodes from pond wastewater.

A Sound-based Machine Learning to Predict Traffic Vehicle Density,"vehicle density, sound features, sound intensity, machine learning, traffic prediction, random forest, artificial neural network, support vector machine","Geoferleen Flores, Eduardo Jr. Piedad, Anzeneth Figueroa, Romari Tumamak, Nesrah Jane Marie Berdon",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.01.05,"Traffic flow mismanagement is a significant challenge in all countries especially in crowded cities. An alternative solution is to utilize smart technologies to predict traffic flow. In this study, frequency spectrum describing traffic sound characteristics is used as an indicator to predict the next five-minute vehicle density. Sound frequency and vehicle intensity are collected during a thirteen-hour data gathering. The collected sound intensity and frequency are then used to learn three machine-learning models - support vector machine, artificial neural network, and random forest and to predict vehicle intensity. It was found out that the performances of the three models based on root-mean-square-error values are 12.97, 16.01, and 10.67, respectively. These initial and satisfactory results pave a new way to predict traffic flow based on traffic sound characteristics which may serve as a better alternative to conventional features.","Caladcad, J.

Uniform Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator of Fractal Dimension,"fractal dimension, fractal distribution, uniform minimum variance unbiased estimator","Zeny L. Maureal, Elmer C. Castillano, Roberto N. Padua",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.01.06,The paper introduced the concept of a fractal distribution using a power-law distribution. It proceeds to determining the relationship between fractal and exponential distribution using a logarithmic transformation of a fractal random variable which turns out to be exponentially distributed. It also considered finding the point estimator of fractional dimension and its statistical characteristics. It was shown that the maximum likelihood estimator of the fractional dimension Î» is biased. Another estimator was found and shown to be a uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) by Lehmann-Scheffeâ€™s theorem.,"Bauke, H. (2007).

Sequential Pattern Mining of Tourist Spatiotemporal Movement,"data mining, sequence pattern mining, spatiotemporal, flowmaps, Aprioriall","Maria Isabel R. Abucejo, Jovelyn C. Cuizon",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.01.07,"The study aimed to develop a software application to capture tourist activity information, extract movement patterns from the dataset through sequential pattern mining (SPM), and visualize spatiotemporal movement. Tourist activity information was captured through crowdsourced trajectory movements by scanning unique QR (Quick Response) codes for each visited tourist spots. The AprioriAll algorithm was used to find frequent trajectory patterns on tourist visits. The resulting maximal k-sequences and their subsequences represent the recommended trip itinerary. The spatial and temporal movements were visualized through a flow map and a heat map, respectively. The directed edges in the flow map show the recommended sequence of tourist sites to visit. The heat map shows the density of tourist visits in different areas at time intervals. The application was validated with selected tour planning experts to verify functional suitability, usability, and acceptability. Experimental results show positive indicators that the application met the usersâ€™ expectations.","Basiri, A., Amirian, P., & Mooney, P. (2016).

Remote Learning Readiness and Challenges: Perceptions and Experiences among Tertiary State University Management Students,"remote learning, online learning, Student Readiness for Online Learning (SROL) instrument",Mary Gretchen F. Chaves,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.01.08,"COVID-19 has disrupted the education system globally, leading education institutions to migrate into remote learning. This study on online learning readiness and competence was conducted among management students on their perceptions on the importance of, and the confidence level of their online learning competence factors. Using the Student Readiness for Online Learning (SROL) instrument, the results show that the students consider Technical Competence as very important and that they are somewhat confident with their online learning competence. Both perceptions of the importance of the online competence factors and competency levels significantly correlate with the studentsâ€™ self-report of whether or not they have learned in the course. Among the eight online learning challenges, the students find the â€œlack of technical skills in using online learningâ€ as the least challenging. This study concludes with the recommendations that pedagogical and technological interventions be pursued to address the inadequacies in the online teaching-learning process.","Alvarez, A. J. (2020).

Methods that were used include descriptive statistics, nonparametric analysis, and survival analysis. Results of the study reveal that women are more susceptible to infection while men are at risk of longer hospitalization and higher mortality. Significant risk factors to COVID-19 mortality are older age, male sex, difficulty breathing, and comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes. Patients with these combined symptoms should be considered for admission to the COVID-19 facility for proper management and care. Also, there is a significant delay in the testing and diagnosis of those who died, implying that timeliness in the testing and diagnosis of patients is crucial in patient survival.","Albert, J.R.G., Orbeta, A.C.

It seeks to address the challenges encountered by science teachers with the current curriculum design. The researchers used a thematic instructional model in giving classroom instruction. Two sets of pre-service teachers, taking part as facilitators and as observers, were purposely chosen in the study. The researchers used convergent mixed methods design in analysing the pre-service teachers' experience and observations in teaching through thematic instruction. Results revealed that the thematic instruction implemented in the study has the potential to address the challenges of the current K to 12 science curriculum in terms of design, lesson content, and implementation. Consequently, the results suggest that the thematic instruction design in the study can be used to help achieve the desired outcomes of the K to 12 Science Curriculum.","Argote, A. B. (2016).

The Market Distortion Effect of Government Intervention in Higher Education,"higher education, government subsidy, government intervention, public HEIs, private HEIs, market distortion",Jezyl C. Cutamora,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.01.11,"In the Philippines, a mixture of public and private higher education institutions (HEIs) exists. Because of the government subsidy among the public HEIs, the major concern of the private sector is the â€œuneven playing fieldâ€. This study hopes to eliminate this unhealthy competition and market distortion in the educational landscape. This study utilizes the quantitative non-experimental retrospective explanatory design. Results show that regardless of the extent of state intervention, the market can be distorted. Hence, assigning specific programs to be offered based on the type of HEI is a good alternative. The programs to be fully subsidized and offered by the government are agriculture, sciences, engineering, manufacturing and construction, and humanities and arts (HA) while services, health and welfare, education and social sciences, business and law programs will be for private sector service providers. This stimulates healthy competition among the HEIs leading to a better","Altbach, P., Reisberg, L. & Rumbley, L. (2009).

Factors Affecting Teachers' Resiliency Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic,"education, resiliency, optimism, job stress, emotional exhaustion, descriptive correlational",Kevin T. Lagat,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.01.12,"Despite the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers continue to navigate the new normal in education which demonstrate their resilience. This descriptive correlational study determined the level of optimism, job stress, and emotional exhaustion of 150 teachers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and it analyzed the relationship among these three variables. The data were analyzed using weighted mean, standard deviation, and Pearson r. Results revealed resiliency among teachers amidst the pandemic with a high level of optimism and a relatively low COVID-19 induced job stress and emotional exhaustion level. This study has also shown that optimism is not correlated with job stress and emotional exhaustion, but it found out significant relationship between the last two variables. Generally, it can be concluded that teachers are highly optimistic amidst the pandemic. This paper also validates earlier claims that lower levels of job stress contribute to lower incidents of emotional exhaustion.","Agaibi, C., & Wilson, J. P. (2005).

Extended Technology Acceptance Model to Examine the Use of Google Forms â€“ based Lesson Playlist in Online Distance Learning,"digital learning technology, extended technology acceptance model, COVID-19, online distance learning, Philippine Senior High School students, PLS-SEM",Fritz M. Ferran,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.01.13,"Shifting to online distance learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic challenged educators' roles as instructional materials designers. This study aimed to examine the students' acceptance of the teacher-designed e-learning tool called Google Forms-based Lesson Playlist (GF-LP) in a home-based online distance learning environment. This quantitative research analyzed 570 responses from Grades 11 and 12 students at a private school in the Philippines using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling. Results showed that perceived self-efficacy and system quality strongly affect the users' perceived ease of use while perceived ease of use highly influenced the students' perceived usefulness of GF-LP. Facilitating conditions do not affect the users' attitudes towards using the e-learning tool, which confirmed the effective utilization of GF-LP in online distance learning. The relationships between the original constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) were also presented. This study recommends the use of GF-LP or its features for remote learning.","Adnan, M., & Anwar, K. (2020). Online learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic: Studentsâ€™ perspectives.
