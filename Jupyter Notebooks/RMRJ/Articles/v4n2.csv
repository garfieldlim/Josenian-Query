Perfect Outer-connected Domination in the Join and Corona of Graphs,"perfect dominating set, outer-connected dominating set, perfect outer-connected dominating set","Enrico Enriquez, Valerie Fernandez, Teodora Punzalan, Jonecis Dayap",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.02.01,"Let G be a connected simple graph. A dominating set S ⊆ V(G) is called a perfect dominating set of G if each u ∈ V(G) \ S is dominated by exactly one element of S. A set S of vertices of a graph G is an outer-connected dominating set if every vertex not in S is adjacent to some vertex in S and the subgraph induced by V(G) \ S is connected. A perfect dominating set S of a graph G is a perfect outer-connected dominating set if the subgraph induced by V(G) \ S is connected. The perfect outer—cormected domination number of G, denoted by γpc (G), is the smallest cardinality of a perfect outer-connected dominating set S of G. A perfect outer-connected dominating set with cardinality γpc (G) is called γpc-set of G. In this paper, we will show that given positive integers, a, b, c, and n such that a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ n — 1, there exists a connected graph G with |V(G)| = n, γ(G) = a, γp (G) = b, and γpc (G) = c. Further, we give the characterization of the perfect outer-connected dominating set of the join and corona of two graphs and give their corresponding perfect outer-connected domination number.","[1] B.

Optimal Scheduling of Battery Energy Storage for Grid-Connected Load Using Photovoltaic System (PV) via Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO),"Binary particle swarm optimization, battery energy storage system, photovoltaic system, interruptible load program, time-of-use scheme","Eduardo D. Piedad Jr., Marc Edwin F. Montilla, Mark Joseph E. Ortega",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.02.04,"This paper presents an optimal dispatch of battery storage and its economic viability with a photovoltaic system. There are four modelled scenarios based on the combination of interruptible load program and the time-of-use scheme. The scenarios were modelled using a Binary Particle Swarm Optimization and were simulated using Matlab v6. In all the scenarios, this model successfully optimizes the battery dispatch scheduling while simultaneously minimizes the DUâ€™s penalty from exceeding the maximum allowable power demand. This algorithm also optimizes the linearly forecasted demand for the next six year for all the scenarios. Then, an economic analysis for the possible investment to the combined BESS and PV system is conducted through the comparison of the payback periods of each scenario. The first scenario is implemented without ILP and a ToU scheme and has 79.86 payback years. With ILP scheme only, the second scenario has 33.37 payback years. Then the third scenario with ToU scheme only has a 30.29 payback years. Finally, the fourth scenario, with both ILP and ToU schemes, shows the fastest recovery of the investment with 21.57 payback years. Thus the combination of both ILP and ToU schemes provide the best economic benefit. Though the current proposed system is still not economically feasible however the foreseen positive trends on solar and battery technologies will make this system viable.",NA,2016-12-31,https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/198
"Practices of Entomophagy and Entomotherapy in Cebu Island, Philippines","Entomophagy, Entomotherapy, Entomology, Key Informants","Jake Joshua Chi Garces, Zanrda O. Jarito, Leslie Ann T. Barriga, Froilen C. Domecillo, Nimfa R. Pansit",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.02.05,"The different features of entomophagy and entomotherapy practiced by the key informants and local villagers in Cebu Island, Philippines were documented.A survey was conducted in remote areas of Barangay Alambijud, Argao and BarangayLusaran, Cebu City, Cebu from June-October,2012 to discover the medicinal and edible uses of different insect species in these sites. Fourteen key informants were identified with the aid of two sampling methods- snowball technique and purposive sampling. Open-ended questionnaires were employed to obtain authentic and significant information from the key informants. An inventory on the knowledge on the wild edible and medicinal insects in the study areas is presented here. Results showedthat these key informants profusely utilized wide range of biological resources in diverse ways, and thus contribute to their daily activities. As a whole, the factors that influenced their entomological practices include their socio-demographic and educational background, accessibility to urban societies and the open availability of certain resources particularly the insects they use and the influence brought about by their family and community. Moreover, these informants had different insects used in their practices, and they had their ways of preparing and administering these as medicines and food. Regardless of these differences, all of them were able to perceive that the insects used as medicine and food were equally beneficial to them.Traditional knowledge regardingentomotherapy and entomophagy in Cebu is very essential since folk medicine is still one of the most important resources for food and discovery of unknown natural drug resources. It is indicated that these medicinal and edible insects are comparable with other conventional food commodities by incorporating scientific validation to the traditional knowledge.","Adalla, C.B. &Cervancia C.

Velez Jr., Ma. Aira Chenessa C. Benitez",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.02.07,"As international criticism of the Philippine governmentâ€™s war on drugs continues, this study aims to find out the rate of drug trafficking incidences of various countries in the world and explore how this is affected by the respective countriesâ€™ legal and socio-economic conditions, specifically: (1) Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per country, (2) public sectorâ€™s perceived corruption index, and (3) countryâ€™s legal standing on prohibited drugs. This study utilizes data mining or exploratory method. Data on the various variables were gathered from statistical reports from various reputable world agencies and subjected to statistical analysis in order to determine their significance in relation to drug trafficking.Â Of the three dimensions analyzed in this study, only economic and social factors show relationship to drug trafficking. Rich countries have less corruption; thus, they have better law-enforcement. As a result, they register more drug trafficking apprehensions. Corrupt countries however, have lower apprehensions; thus, registering a lower drug trafficking rate. Poor countries register higher corruption index and lesser apprehensions of illegal drugs. To fight drug trafficking, it is important to eradicate corruption in order to gain ground in the fight against drugs.The lone dimension that shows no relationship is the political dimension such as restrictive and non-restrictive government policies on drugs. This is corroborated by other studies that indicated a War on Drugs to be ineffective as compared to drug treatment.","Fazey, C. (2007).

Studentsâ€™ Grade vs. Teachersâ€™ Evaluation: An Empirical Validation,"midterm grade, teacherâ€™s evaluation, education",Jesse Sagayno Susada,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.02.08,"The importance of studentâ€™s evaluation for promotion leads teachers to be lenient in exchange of a good evaluation result.Â  This study looks into the possible effects of midterm grades to the evaluation results of teachers at the end of the semester.Â  The study utilized data mining approach using midterm grades and evaluation results of full-time and part-time faculty members.Â  Both parametric and non-parametric analyses were employed in the study. Findings revealed a weak correlation between the midterm grades of students and their evaluation rating of teachers.Â  Looking at grading leniency versus teacher status, it was found out that grades of full-time faculty was significantly higher compared to part time and grades of tenured faculty was significantly higher compared to their probationary counterpart.Â  Therefore, administrators in higher education institution, who uses studentâ€™s evaluation result as a key indicator of instructorâ€™s effectiveness, should be very careful as these results might not represent the true performance of a teacher inside the classroom.","Barry, T. & Thomson, R.

Reality of Human Experience and the Search for Unity,"Philosophy, Philosophy of Man, human experience, unity.",Mario Mapote,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.02.10,"Manâ€™s basic attitude towards reality determines his end.Â  Man either opts to accept reality and becomes an optimist or denies and becomes a pessimist.Â  The study presented the reality of human experience.Â  And these experiences of human reality all boil into the experience of oneâ€™s self and become a test of subjectivity.Â  In the history of philosophy of Man, this outlook into the experience of the self develops into three stages: first, dualism propagated by the Greeks and Aristotle turned into second, monism which extremely focused on one aspect of human reality in relation to man, then, turned into pluralism which views various aspects of man in relation to the kind of society that becomes the by-product of such development and yet makes the identity of man more complicated.Â  In the history of philosophy, human consciousness was so caught up in dualism between body and spirit-mind that became an issue for philosophers like the Greek such as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle and followers such as Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes and others until it split into extreme monism of either materialism or intellectualism-spiritualism developed into more complex pluralism that resulted to a pluralist society.Â  Hence, there is a call for unity especially for existential-phenomenologist in order to gather and link every piece of event and experience into a complete history of human reality as well as to form this experiential event called humanity.","Aquino, R., 1991, Man at Worship: A Philosophical Study of Religion, Lyceum of Aparri.
