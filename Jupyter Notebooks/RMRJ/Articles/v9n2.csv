Feynman Technique as a Heutagogical Learning Strategy for Independent and Remote Learning,"heutagogy, learning strategy, independent learning, remote learning, experimental research, new normal in education","Englevert P. Reyes, Ron Mhel Francis L. Blanco, Defanee Rose L. Doroon, Jay Lord B. Limana, Ana Marie A. Torcende",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.02.06,"The Feynman Technique is a mental model and learning strategy used to simplify any complex information. This study endeavors to provide empirical evidence on the effectiveness of the Feynman Technique as a heutagogy-based learning strategy that fits the e-learning landscape. Utilizing true experimental research design, grades 4, 7, and 11 students from typical elementary and national high schools were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups and underwent pre- and posttests. Using two-sample and paired T-tests, results show that students under the experimental group, which applied the Feynman Technique, showed higher posttest scores and learning gains than those in the control group. Hence, this study proves that the Feynman Technique can be an effective tool to improve K-12 studentsâ€™ learning, especially now given the new learning delivery modalities.","Adonis, M. (2020).

However, the extent of integration in the science curriculum is not widely known in the Philippines. In this convergent mixed-method design, the researchers determined the SHS Chemistry teachersâ€™ (n=30) knowledge, perceptions, GC integration in Chemistry topics, and challenges in teaching Green Chemistry Education (GCE). Complementary quantitative and qualitative results showed valid and reliable findings, claiming that teachers have limited preconceived knowledge on GCE but perceived it as an essential part of the teaching-learning process. Awareness of chemical hazards and their impacts on the environment is often demonstrated but rarely elaborated during discussions in Chemistry classes. Problems encountered in teaching GCE were also identified. A moderate positive correlation between the teachersâ€™ knowledge and their GC perception was observed. However, no significant relationship was found when the teachersâ€™ knowledge and perception were correlated to GC integration.","Ajewole G.A., Nzewi U., & Aganga A.B. (2009).

This descriptive-correlational study aims to determine the various macro and micro context factors in English language learning of secondary students (n=189) under modular distance learning. Factor analysis is utilized in extracting the following factor loadings for macro-context: a) lack of assistance from more knowledgeable others, b) unconducive-to-learning environment, c) cultural influence, d) poor feedback mechanism, e) insufficient resources, and f) low quality of the self-learning kit. Micro-context factors constitute the following: a) lack of exposure and practice, b) lack of perceived competence, c) lack of motivation and d) lack of interest. Students employed self-regulated strategies and managed to overcome these challenges through a) commitment to practice the skill, b) self-evaluation strategies, and c) social strategies.

Visayan Philosophy of Labor: A Reflection from the Notion of Kahimtang and John Paul IIâ€™s Philosophy,"Kahimtang, Labor, John Paul II, Filipino Philosophy, Visayan Philosophy","Arian G. Acampado, Glenn G. Pajares",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.02.07,"This paper highlights John Paul IIâ€™s (JPII) Philosophy of Labor and points out the need to have a Visayan philosophy of labor. Moreover, this proposes to view and analyze the Visayan philosophy of labor within the context of the Visayan notion of kahimtang. The researchers believe that the word kahimtang can be viewed as a combination of three words ka, himu and butang, in which himu connotes a concept of work. Furthermore, within the compatibilist minds of the Visayan, himu (labor) plays a significant role to redirect oneâ€™s kahimtang. Work (labor), for the Visayan, is an essential expression of freedom which has a similar expression to JPIIâ€™s Philosophy of Labor.","Acaali, C. (1997). A study of John Paul IIâ€™s theology

Challenges and Opportunities in Philippine Tourism amid the COVID-19 Pandemic,"tourism, tourism industry, challenges and opportunities, COVID-19, Philippines","Deoan D. Andulana, Mayuan T. Calijan, Albert C. Albina",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj.2109.02.08,"This exploratory study aims to discuss the multifaceted challenges and opportunities of the Philippine tourism industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges and opportunities are organized by following the elements of anti-pandemic strategies in the COVID-19 Management Framework. Some pressing challenges are the decline in tourism demand, layoff of workers, demand for online/digital transactions, avoidance of tourists to occupy hotel rooms used as quarantine facilities, and compliance of disaster management and control preparedness protocols. However, tourism industry can thrive through ample opportunities like exploring local tourism, training employees on digital services and on safety protocols, rebuilding company brand, improving business facilities, adapting to modern technology, and collaborating with consultants on disaster and risk management. These challenges and opportunities provide the bases for suggestions and recommendations
to improve policies for future pandemic planning to cushion any potential impact on the tourism industry.","Ackehurst, M., & Loveder, P. (2015). Building the

The findings reveal that the sanitary conditions of utensils and equipment, the sanitary operations and facilities, the monitoring of time and temperatures, and the maintenance of the sanitary conditions in the facility need major improvement to increase food safety compliance and to contribute in mitigating the transmission of COVID-19. Minor improvements are needed in the handwashing facility, the implementation of the water potability program, Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures, personnel disease control, and hygienic practices. Moreover, the lack of technical knowledge and time to manage and continuously improve food safety system are the challenges experienced by the FBOs. These findings are instrumental to the improvement of the food safety practices, formulation of relevant policies, and conceptualization of research in mitigating COVID-19 relevant to food safety.","Aday, S., & Aday, M.

On the Generators of the Group of Units Modulo a Prime and Its Analytic and Probabilistic Views,"Generators of (Zp)* ,, Simulation algorithm, Group of units modulo a prime p, (Zp)*","Ricky B. Villeta, Elmer C. Castillano, Roberto N. Padua",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.02.03,"This paper further investigates the cyclic group (Zp)* with respect to the primitive roots or generators g ∈ (Zp)*. The simulation algorithm that determines the generators and the number of generators, g of (Zp)* for a prime p is illustrated using Python programming. The probability of getting a generator g of (Zp)*, denoted by (Ø(Ø(p)))/(Ø(p)), is generated for prime p between 0 to 3000. The scatterplot is also shown that depicts the data points on the probability (Ø(Ø(p)))/(Ø(p)) of the group of units (Zp)* with respect to the order p - 1 of (Zp)* for prime p between 0 to 3000. The scatterplot results reveal that the probability of getting a generator of the group of units (Zp)* is fluctuating within the probability range of 0.20 to 0. 50, for prime p modulus from 3 to 3000. These findings suggest that the proportion of the number of generators of the group of units modulo a prime of order p - 1, though fluctuating, is bounded from 20% to 50% for prime p modulus from 3 to 3000.","Adamski, T., & Nowakowski, W.

Approximate Analytic Solution to the Three Species Lotka â€“ Volterra Differential Equation Model,"approximation, analytic solution, Lotka-Volterra, differential equation model",Dionisel Y. Regalado,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj.2109.02.09,"This paper provides an approximate analytic solution to the three species Lotka â€“ Volterra differential equations by symbolic regression. The approximate analytic solution through symbolic regression is made as close as desired to the actual analytic solution by using the Jacobian system. This is proposed as the equilibrium will be stabilized if and only if the real parts of each of the eigenvalues are negative. As a result, the symbolic regression approach is found to provide an approximation to the faster convergence that can be expected with a more refined Euler numerical approach.","Cassol, M., Wortmann, S., & Rizza, U.

"Rice Machinery Requirement in La Union, Philippines: A Basis for Prioritizing Deployment","agricultural engineering, agricultural machinery, mechanization level, Philippines",Rosalinda L. Abad,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.02.01,"The implementation of the Republic Act No. 11203 mandates the development of a just and appropriate agricultural mechanization strategy. Thus, this study is conceptualized to calculate the rice machinery requirement and the mechanization level of La Union, Philippines. The utilization rate of existing machinery considers 100% and 70% in case the calculation is surplus. Furthermore, this aims to validate if there is no machinery requirement despite the 30% decrease in utilization rate. Hence, the results have revealed a need for 674 units of riding-type transplanters, 31 units of a rice combine harvester, 422 units of recirculating dryers, and 61 units of multi-pass rice mills. The rice mechanization level is moderately mechanized. However, only tillage operation is moderately mechanized; the transplanting, harvesting, drying and milling are low mechanised. These findings could serve as bases in the formulation of policies and strategies prioritizing suitable areas for
machinery intervention in the province.","Amare, D., & Endalew, W. (2016).
