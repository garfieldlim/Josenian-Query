Joint Manipulation Instruction in the Physical Therapy Curriculum of Select Philippine Higher Education Institutions,"Philippine physical therapy program, Philippine physical therapy HEI, manual therapy curriculum, manipulation, mobilization","Lily Ann D. Bautista, Andrei A. Altavas, Cyflor E. Putong, Romel V. Cabazor",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.01.01,"The physical therapy graduate must possess the necessary competencies in manipulation as recommended by the World Confederation for Physical Therapy Guidelines for Entry-Level Education. This study aimed to investigate the inclusion of joint manipulation instruction in Philippine Physical Therapy Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and determine the factors affecting its implementation. A cross-sectional descriptive survey was used to collect data and analyze findings. The Department Heads of government recognized physical therapy schools were invited to participate in the study and thirty-five schools responded to the survey. Results showed that there was limited inclusion of manipulation in the physical therapy curriculum of select Philippine HEIs, with lesser application of the techniques in the spine as compared to the extremities. The respondents reported that the lack of qualified faculty in their respective institutions was the primary reason for the limited
inclusion of thrust manipulation in the curriculum.","American Physical Therapy Association, (2009).

The Morphological Processes Involved in the Lexicon of Iligan Cityâ€™s Tambal Binisaya,"alternative medicine, lexicon, morphology, folk customs, material culture",Lourd Greggory D. Crisol,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.01.02,"Tambal Binisaya refers to the folk medicine used in Iligan City, Philippines. These medicines have been used for decades by mananambals or local folk healers and residents from low-income groups. However, because of modern treatments, the locals have started to move away from Tambal Binisaya. Because of this, many residents have become unfamiliar to Tambal Binisaya and the terms used in the trade. Thus, this ethnolinguistic study looked into the lexicon of Tambal Binisaya, specifically word formation processes involved in the names of these folk medicines. In doing so, the researcher employed interviews, observations and field notes in data gathering. Based on the results of the study, it was found that the morphological processes used are: affixation, enclitization, reduplication, metanalysis, compounding, blending, borrowing and coining. It is concluded that there indeed lies a rich trove of lexical items in Tambal Binisaya which should be given more societal and academic attention.","Bautista. M. L. (1996).

Knowledge Sharing as Communication via James W. Careyâ€™s Communication as Culture,"James W. Careyâ€™s ritual view and transmission view of communication, symbolic interactionism, research academics, Philippines",Melanie D. BacuÃ±o,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.01.03,"Knowledge sharing in the academic setting can be conceptualized as a form of communication that has a potential for socio-cultural communication studies. This study argues that examining the discourse of James W. Carey on communication as culture, particularly his discussion on transmission and ritual views of communication, can deepen understanding of knowledge sharing among the research academics from a communication standpoint. Applying one of Herbert Blumerâ€™s assumptions on symbolic interactionism, this study further argues that the meaning of knowledge sharing as a form of communication among research academics could be found in the process by which the academics interact symbolically with others within and outside the academic community. The findings affirm through a phenomenological research design that knowledge sharing is communication. New perspectives in this communication phenomenon are examined through the ritual view of communication with interesting implications with the New Media Theory and with
the symbolic interaction framework.","Aldieri, L., Guida, G., Kotsemir, M., & Vinci, C. P. (2019).

An Economic Rationalization Framework for Higher Education,"rationalization framework, HEIs, subsidy, data mining",Jezyl C. Cutamora,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.01.04,"The marginal rate of returns (MRR) of higher education programs affect a countryâ€™s economy. It is in this light that the current study primarily intends to determine which higher education programs the state should fully subsidize and which programs the private education service providers should take charge of. The net effect of this identification is to rationalize the supply side of the economy. Quantitative non-experimental retrospective explanatory design and data mining techniques were used. Consequently, based on the programsâ€™ marginal rate of returns, indeed there are certain higher education services that bring about public good while some others do not. Agriculture, services, humanities and arts, sciences, health and welfare, engineering, manufacturing and construction, and education programs demonstrate greater public good while social sciences, business, and law generally promote greater private returns to the individuals rather than to the society.","Altbach, P., Reisberg, L. and Rumbley, L .2009.

"A Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) Model to Forecasting Tourist Arrival in the Philippines: A Case Study in Moalboal, Cebu (Philippines)","Tourism demand forecasting, time series forecasting, SARIMA, stochastic processes, seasonal time series","Severina P. Velos, Marivel B. Go, Glynne P. Bate, Elvira B. Joyohoy",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.01.05,"Forecasting plays a critical part in implementing effective tourism management strategies. However, the role of tourism forecasting is not extensively studied in the Philippines, which is a key tourism destination in Southeast Asia. To address such gap, this paper explores the dynamics of tourist demand in the Philippines through a case study. It illustrates the tourist arrival using a SARIMA model. Results show that the adopted methodology was able to capture the dynamics of the tourist demand in the Philippines. By providing lenses to the Philippine tourism case, this paper would help shed light to the gaps in the literatureâ€™s current understanding of tourism in the Philippines. Moreover, these findings would be beneficial for stakeholders in shaping policies, strategies, and other tourism initiatives.","Abellana, D. P. M., Rivero, D. M. C., Aparente, M. E., &

Religiosity and Spiritual Well-Being of Senior High School Students of a Catholic College in the Philippines,"religiosity, spiritual well-being, religious well-being, existential well-being, senior high school students, descriptive-correlational, Catholic school, Philippines","Dennis V. Madrigal, Rosabella P. Erillo, Enrique G. Oracion",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.01.06,"This study examined the religiosity and spiritual well-being of Catholic senior high school students of a rural Catholic school. Using the descriptive-comparative and correlational research design, data collection involved the survey questionnaires and hypotheses-testing used the Mann Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis, and Pearson r. In general, the students demonstrated a very high extent of religiosity, but they significantly differ when compared by grade level, church involvement, mass attendance, and Catholic identity. They had moderate spiritual well-being, but a significant difference was noted between males and females. Nevertheless, a significant relationship exists between religiosity and spiritual wellbeing, which suggests that the more the students observe Catholic teachings and practices, the more they mature in God's personal experience and achieve a sense of satisfaction and purpose in life. This study provides baseline data for developing the religious education curriculum and enhancing the campus ministry programs and activities of the said school.","Abu-Raiya, H., Pargament, K.

Thus, this study develops Companion, an app that utilizes the KNN algorithm to create a social support group that matches a seeker to the group based on his interest and problem at hand. He finds new friends with whom he can feel a sense of care, love, understanding, and belongingness. It comes with a set of physical activities designed for the group.

Death and Food Offering: The Ilocano â€œAtangâ€ Ritual from a Contextual Theology,"Ilocano Atang, Communion of Saints, food offering, dead/departed",Jeff Clyde G. Corpuz,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.01.08,"Atang (food offering) is an indigenous ritual for the dead in the Northern Philippines. The atang ritual is thought to be a part of the cultural and religious contexts of the Ilocano people. This research argued that the Ilocanosâ€™ practice of atang ritual is compatible with the Catholic Doctrine on the Communion of Saints. This study utilized descriptive and contextual approaches in doing inculturation. It used the purposive sampling technique to Ilocano participants and discussed the development of doing a local theology of atang ritual in the faith of Ilocano Catholics. Results of the study revealed that the atang ritual has significant implications in the faith of the Ilocano Catholics in terms of the importance of remembering the dead as way to elaborate the doctrine of the communion of Saints. Thus, the concept of the communion of saints can be understood in the context of food offering for the dead.","Abad, R. (1995). Filipino religiosity: Some international comparisons.
