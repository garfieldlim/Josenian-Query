Impact of Perceptions apropos Economic Growth,"Asian Economy, perception, economic growth","NiÃ±a Ann Margaret M. Geniston, Michelle Q. Cabahug, Marjurie Lourince E. Zanoria, Kristine June D. Uy",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.02.01,"The Asian economy has been continuously growing since the beginning of the 21st century. Asian countries are starting to carve their names in the A-list of the growing world economy. Considering the stability of its excellent performance in a continual growth, the researchers endeavored to find out whether what a countryâ€™s economic growth is reflected in the level of satisfaction of its citizens.Using exploratory data analysis, indices pertinent relating to general perception, social trust, security, government performance, and professional relations were calculated. Results showed that countries which are generally perceived to be not doing well in terms of economy seem to exhibit a higher level of satisfaction from its citizens.","Alfaro, L., Chanda, A., Kalemli-Ozcan, S., & Sayek, S.

Non-Random Walk Behavior of Philippine Stock Prices,"Random walk, unit root, autocorrelations, sequences, reversals, runs",Rhenozo Barte,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.02.02,"Random walk has been held as a sufficient condition for describing the stock market as efficient, which implies that investors cannot predict the market returns or equivalently, abnormal profits cannot be obtained just by knowing the past prices. This study tests the random walk hypothesis in the case of Philippine Stock Prices, using the daily PSE index (PSEi) covering the period 03 January 2005-16 February 2016. Main results, employing the informal or visual methods such as plot analysis of log returns and correlogram, suggest some initial evidence of non-randomness. The formal methods, employing tests for unit root, runs, sequences and reversals, variance ratio, and autocorrelations, show that the PSEi prices do not follow a random walk behavior.","Journals

Resolving Ethical Dilemmas of Human Resource Management In The Academe: A Decision-Making Process Model,"Human resource management, ethical dilemmas, decision-making process, grounded theory, resolution","Joel B. Serad, Mathea M. Baguia",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.02.03,"The study explored on the ethical dilemmas of human resource managers and uncovered the process by which the managers resolve the dilemmas. This study used a grounded theory approach to formulate a basic social process model (theoretical model) of resolving those moral conflicts. All informants are human resource managers from private higher education institutions. The study followed the Glasserian grounded theory analysis to formulate a resolution process theory using the data gathered from the beginning. With the use of grounded theory analysis, it was found out that the six main processes used by the informants were (1) Consistency with policies; (2) Character check; (3) Considering consequences; (4) Communication; (5) Cultural sensitivity; and (6) Counteractive mechanism.","Becker, W.

The Duplicitous Character of Bilingual Education Policy,"Bilingual, Education, Cultural complexities, Cebu, Philippines","Gaurang Rami, Ana Marie Fernandez",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.02.05,"This study investigated the positioning of teacher education institutions (TEIs) in the glocalization continuum of bilingual complexities in responding to the global and local demands for harmonious and peaceful nation building. This study was exploratory in nature. The researchers used survey questionnaires to account the effects of more than four decades of enforcement of Bilingual Education in the Microcosm area in Cebu City (Philippines).Stratified sampling technique was employed; wherein strata were divided based on specialization of the 213 pre-service teachers. Cronbachâ€™sÂ alpha was usedto measure reliability and internal consistency of the instrument. Principle component method through factor analysis was utilized to reduce the data complexity and to identify important factors of bilingual education policy. Results revealed that bilingual education policy has duplicitous character in a non-native English country. Yet, it is a tool that can propel nation building. Much of it lies in the hands of the teacher education institutionsâ€™ power and capacity to ignite other industries of the country.","Anderson, N., & Pyle, A. (1998, May 18).

ASEAN Integration: The Domination and Subordination among Member Nations,"ASEAN integration, competition, cooperation, economic disparity, regional cooperation","Herben M. Tautho, Maria Sheila E. CaÃ±ete",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.02.06,"The ASEAN from its original purpose of conception has evolved into what it is envisioned now of integrating the 10 individual economies into a single regional economy. Its traditional practice of consensus and consultation poses a challenge and as a factor in lagging behind the development of its implementation. But what state from among the ten members is the best candidate to lead the organization remained to be a question. This research explores the possibility of determining the potential leader of the organization by considering several variables like corruption perception index, global competitiveness, government effectiveness, GNI, etc. and utilized the process known as exploratory data analysis or data mining in gathering data. Data gathered were then processed through the use of statistical software to cluster the variables. Cluster analysis was then performed to establish relevant relationships, similarities, or differences of the data collected. Results and data gathered from several relevant studies about the topic were also collectively analyzed to determine the gap of perspectives from other notable scholars and to gain new insights to fill in that gap. Based on this method of analysis, it was revealed that thereâ€™s a single country that stands out from the rest and is the best candidate to lead the ASEAN Integration. A new paradigm shift is beginning to surface from collective to a single leadership.","Alave, K. L. (2006). Private sector not ready for ASEAN economic union. BusinessWorld, , 1.

Morality and Religiosity: A Filipino Experience,"morality, religiosity, human person, relevance of morality and religiosity",Sheldon Ives G. Agaton,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.02.07,"The concepts of morality and religiosity have been associated with each other in a manner that these two co-exist and they are of equal importance for a human personâ€™s eventual ideal character. Accordingly, moral philosophy teaches that a personâ€™s moral foundation can be linked to his spiritual foundation and vice versa as one of religionsâ€™ thrusts is construct the moral fibers necessary for manâ€™s ethical existence. A human personâ€™s spirituality and morality are substantial parts of his nature that he has to learn, nourish and value them so that he may develop into an ideal human person that he is suppose to be. He does not only have to indoctrinate and inculcate one of which and despise the other. This paper generally talks about the notions of Morality and Religiosity. Further, it also discusses on the interrelation of the two as the human person applies the same to actual convictions in life. Finally, a category is presented on what a person should ideally be as the two concepts are intertwined. This paper utilized the expository-descriptive type of research. Books, articles and other similar write-ups from the library, internet and other sources coupled with observations in the experiential world were the primary references. Such method was facilitative in the full realization of this research paper.","Anonymous. â€œKarma in Hinduism,â€ ReligionFacts. July 3, 2007.

Effectiveness of Custard Apple (Annona squamosa) Seed Extract in Treating Pediculosis Capitis,"Pediculosis capitis, Annona squamosa, permethrin, pediculicide, extract","Jellemer M. Benitez, Chelsea V. Cimafranca, Louisse Phillina Paz V. Gimenez, Jezyl C. Cutamora",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.02.08,"Pediculosis capitis infestation, commonly known as head lice, a worldwide public health concern affecting individuals of all age groups, and prevalence in the general population can be as high as 40 percent. The main task attained in the study was the determination of the pediculicidal effects of Annona squamosa seed extract of different concentrations. Methodology utilized a true experimental design done in 3 trials; 10 live head lice were observed under each concentration of 25%, 50%, 75% atis seeds extract for the experimentation and 75% permethrin concentration as controlled group. In vitro testing was used and the subjects were placed in prepared petri dishes for experimentation. Data results found out that there is p-value of 0.067 at Î± = 0.05 for mean time elapsed (secs) for 100% head lice mortality. Significant p-level of 0.002 for pediculicidal activity for the first 5 minutes has been noted. The researchers derived up with a conclusion that Custard Apple (Annona squamosa) seed extract in 75%, 50% and 25% concentration is as effective as Commercial Pediculicide (Permethrin) in killing pediculosis Capitis. 50% concentration has comparable results to Permethrin and is the most effective due to its earlier onset of pediculicidal activity.","AlBashtawy, M. & Hasna, F.

Levels of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment Success among ASEAN Countries,"Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), multivariate cluster analysis, principal component analysis, health expenditure, adult literacy rate","Mark Ian C.

The global issue of tuberculosis has been a well-known communicable disease which could result in another type of such disease, if untreated. This study is conducted to assess the treatment success of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases, which had been a burden for countries in terms of financial aspects. Through the use of multivariate cluster and principal component analyses, ASEAN countries were grouped and ranked from very highly successful to least successful in the level of treatment success which would provide comprehensive findings as to what ASEAN country successfully provides financial to their diagnosed patients. Further, it was found out that the level of success of MDR-TB treatments among ASEAN countries varies inversely with the number of patients undergoing the treatment while directly proportional to the amount of investments in health expenditures. Hence, MDR-TB treatment success depends on the level of amount of investments for health the ASEAN country has and the number of patients undergoing the treatment. Thus, the success of the treatment can be achieved at high economic price.","Albanna, A. S., & Menzies, D. (2011). Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis. Drugs,71(7), 815-825.

Cutamora",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.02.12,"This study aimed to determine the predictors of subjective wellbeing among elderly. The researcher utilized a descriptive correlational design to identify patterns of relationship that existed between the variables and to measure the strength of the relationship, which in this case involved the individual variables (educational attainment, health status, employment status, and presence of stressors), family variables (marital status, family size, family income, quality of family relationship, and family support) and social characteristics (social relationships, church attendance, access to amenities/ transportation, safe environment and community participation) and the level of subjective wellbeing among the elderly. The study was conducted in the municipality of Sagbayan, Bohol, Philippines. The researcher utilized a self-made questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale, Spiritual Wellbeing Scale and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) to gather the needed information relevant to the variables under study. Multiple regression and analysis of variance through the SPSS software were utilized in the treatment and analysis of the data. It was found out that the mean level of subjective wellbeing among elderly falls under the average level of life satisfaction which means that the elderlies are generally satisfied with the different aspects of their lives but there are certain domains that they would very much like to improve. The study also revealed that the significant predictive variables for the elderliesâ€™ subjective wellbeing include age, health status, perceived stress, community participation, family income, and neighborhood safety. Implications of these results are noted for the development of programs and initiatives to enhance subjective wellbeing.","Ballescas,Â J.

Moral Culture in Kantâ€™s On Education (1803): Implications and Antitheses,"philosophy, Immanuel Kant, On Education, moral culture, qualitative research",Albert Albina,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.02.13,"The Philippines has been inundated with socio-politico issues that impede peopleâ€™s desire for the countryâ€™s uninterrupted progress. These issues may be complex but their antidote is contrarily simple. An answer is found in Immanuel Kantâ€™s thought on moral culture which pertains to three essential features, namely: obedience, truthfulness, and sociableness. This qualitative research focuses on the fundamental ideas in the section on moral culture in Kantâ€™s On Education. As my contribution to the fund of knowledge, I proceed by establishing the implications and antitheses of the three features of Kantâ€™s moral culture. A discussion on obedience differentiates its two kinds: absolute and voluntary. Absolute obedience is the result of compulsion by a command, while voluntary obedience is the result of confidence by a reasonable will. It is impossible to think of character formation without also thinking of truthfulness. Kant asserts that a man who tells lies has no character. Sociableness emphasizes on the importance of building relationships and friendships. The researcher contends that these three features of moral culture have corresponding antitheses: violation of laws of the land for obedience; lying and dishonesty (highest form is corruption in politics) for truthfulness; and human rights violation (highest form is war) for sociableness. Finally, these features are imperative in forging peace and social order which usher to a kind of development that people aspire.","Blackburn, Keith & Forgues-Puccio, Gonzalo F. (2009).

Mother- Tongue Based Multilingual Education Certificate Program vis- a- vis Pupilsâ€™Academic Performance in Public Elementary Schools in Cebu,"mother-tongue based multilingual education, academic achievement, public schools, K to 12","Jestoni P. Babia, Helmae N. Etulle-Tapanan, Juleita M. Catipay, Lea Mae A. Ladonga",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.02.04,"This study investigates the effectiveness of the Mother-Tongue Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE) Certificate Program to the academic performance of pupils utilizing their first language in learning. Teacher-scholarsâ€™ performance were measured in terms of teaching-learning and teaching facilitation. Moreover, pupilsâ€™ satisfaction level were determined based on the comparison of teachersâ€™ performance as scholars, trained and non-trained. The findings of this study revealed that teacher-scholars who enrolled in the certificate program showed positive and direct effect to pupilsâ€™ academic performance. An increase of pupilsâ€™ achievement and satisfaction level towards learning using MTB-MLE as a medium of instruction was grounded on the intensity of teachersâ€™ training about the implementation of MTB-MLE in each grade level. Furthermore, scrutinizing the differences of both teachersâ€™ performance and pupilsâ€™ performance in Grades 1-3 will be helpful in determining more provisions to make the K to 12 implementation more effective and more understandable to individuals within the cycle of learning.","Ausabel D.

Social lifestyles such as multiple sexual partnerships, commitment, protected sex practices, and health checkups are lifestyle factors that can impact on the rate at which entry into any of the epidemiologic compartments S, I or D (death) slows or accelerates. Functional relationships between these social parameters and the disease parameters determined the model developed in this study and used predictive agent-based model to simulate the level of spread of HIV cases in Cebu with base data of the risky lifestyle of BPO agents in the region that could make them vulnerable to infections. Simulation results revealed that there is a rise on the incidence of HIV infections every year, which could become an epidemic in the future if no immediate intervention will be done. Â This high incidence of HIV cases in Cebu as evidenced by simulation results reflect the lack of awareness, prompt action, and policy in Cebu City with regards to mitigating the spread of the virus. Sans any intervention, the incidence of HIV infection can accelerate further in the future.","Anderson & Dahlberg, High-risk Sexual Behavior in the General Population (Results from a National Survey, 1988-1990), 1992
