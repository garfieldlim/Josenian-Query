"Fun and Fearless: Magazine Covers, Feminine Ideologies, and Representations","multimodal critical discourse, feminine ideologies, magazine cover, language and media, representation",Claudette A. Baluran,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1806.01.01,"Starting with the assumption that media, particularly magazines, serve as a ground that shape the ideological landscape for women representations, this paper explored feminine ideologies and representations of twelve (12) Cosmopolitan Philippines magazine covers from the year 2015. Underlying ideological structures were found not only in the linguistic but symbolic features of the text as well.Â  Employing the methodologies of multimodal critical discourse analysis, the investigation revealed emerging patterns on how women are portrayed and represented in the magazine covers.Â  The â€œfun and fearlessâ€ catchphrase that the magazine has shaped to define the modern Filipina (a) presents them as hypersexualized and practicing adventurous sex, (b) positions them as followers of health and beauty regimens and glamorous lifestyle that ultimately lead to the affirmation of the opposite sex, and (c) objectifies them through come-hither poses and scantily-clad bodies that emphasize the cleavage, toned abdomens, and legs.Â  The paper also discussed the possible implications brought about by the perpetuation of these ideological structures.","Allen, J.

Rethinking Catholic Education: Experiences of Teachers of a Catholic University,"Catholic Education, Catholic School, Evangelization","Dennis V. Madrigal, Enrique G. Oracion",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1806.01.02,"Catholic education is closely linked to the evangelical mission of the Church. As such, the primary intent of Catholic education is to proclaim the message of salvation to all people. Accordingly, Catholic education aims to provide an integral formation with a religious dimension that will equip the human person to become life, work, and mission ready and attain salvation. But given the contemporary socio-economic, cultural, political, and technological milieus characterized by a secular and consumerist view and praxis, the value of Catholic education may have been obscured or affected.Â  Thus, this paper aims to investigate and analyze the views and practices of the faculty of a Catholic University about Catholic education. The purposive sampling method was used to determine the participants in the study. Using a qualitative research design, the data were gathered from the participants using the face-to-face interview method. Aided by the phenomenological method, the findings discovered semblance in the participants' views and practices of Catholic education with that of Catholic Church. Despite the observed undesirable elements that obscure and marginalize it, Catholic education faithfully remains a Catholic. But making religion as the core of the curriculum of Catholic education is still a great challenge for Catholic schools to realize. Thus, the collaboration of all stakeholders is vital to address this perennial challenge in Catholic education.","Alfante, F. L., & Aguiling, H. M. (2015).

Linguistic and Sociolinguistic Competence of Senior High School Students,"speaking competence, K to 12 curricula, linguistic competence, sociolinguistic competence, discourse competence, strategic competence","Ionell Jay R. Terogo, Crismae Amor C. Elimino, John Paulo M. Tallo, Johanna A. Sacal, Charles Martin Joseph E. Balahadia",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1806.01.03,"This study aims to identify whether the Senior High School students are Linguistic, Discourse, Sociolinguistic or Strategic Competent in English. Quantitative and qualitative research methods were used to collate a survey that would sure mend the study. With comprehensive computation of the random datasets, almost every Senior High School student achieved a satisfactory rating in both the Perceptions and Abilities Categories. A Chi-Square Statistic was also used and yielded maximum values which consequently, resulted to low p-values, suggesting the negation of the studyâ€™s null hypothesis. The result is further supported using the correlation statistic which corresponds to a high correlation between the studentsâ€™ Perceptions and Abilities in their speaking competence. The outcome of the summary of all competencies show that the Linguistic Competence contributed the most to the overall language intents of the students with sociolinguistic competence giving the least, which results in Linguistic Competence being the widely used language competency and sociolinguistic as not often practiced language skill amongst the students. With this, the Senior High School students are far more competent in phonetics, pronunciation, Phonology, Morphology, Syntax and Semantics rather than on the socio-cultural languages such as vocabulary, politeness and language style.","Anderson, A. & Lynch, T.

This calls for looking into factors that influence a consumerâ€™s decision to buy online. With this, the present study investigated four variables namely consumer innovativeness, perceived benefit, perceived risk, and brand image and its impact toward consumerâ€™s decision to buy online. To address this aim, four hundred eighty (480) participants were recruited online and randomly assigned into one of the sixteen treatment conditions with the presence and/or absence of the four variables being investigated. Results of two-way analysis of variance showed that, in an online selling platform, the presence of consumer innovativeness and perceived benefit, the presence of perceived benefit and perceived risk, and brand image had significant influence in oneâ€™s decision to buy online. Findings provide implications towards improving an online websiteâ€™s shopping platform which may motivate the consumer to buy.","Ajzen, I. (1991). The theory of planned behavior.
