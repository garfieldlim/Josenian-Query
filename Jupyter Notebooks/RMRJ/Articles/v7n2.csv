Improved Integrated Crop Management System of Mungbean (Vigna radiata Linn) Production in Central Luzon,"integrated crop management, increase production, mungbean, Central Luzon","Mary Grace B. Gatan, Menrado T. Gatan",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.02.01,"To address low productivity and increase income, studies were conducted to improve the integrated crop management (ICM) of mungbean. Field experiments established using extracts, biocon agents, and varieties under various cropping systems. In rice-mungbean cropping system, Pagasa 19 applied with Vermitea and Carrageenan exhibited lowest CLS and rust infections. Carrageenan-treated plants produced yield, 0.77t/ha vs Control 0.41t/ha. Under corn-mungbean cropping system, Carrageenan-treated Pagasa 19 had the highest yield of 1.36t/ha. In other trials, CLS infection of Carrageenan-treated Pagasa 19 was reduced by 25.6% and the yield/ha was 62.3% higher than untreated valued at Php 29, 400.00/ha. In Pagasa 7, Carrageenan is effective against CLS and rust, and gave the highest yield of 1.37 ton/ha. The Kulabo, whether applied with Carrageenan, Boron or NPV, reduced the CLS infection and increased the yield up to 0.54t/ha. Improved ICM system is vital to reduce loss, improve soil condition, and enhance yield and income.","Abad, L.V., Aurigue F.B., Relleve L.S., Montefalcon D.R.V., & Lopez G.E.P. (2015).

Enhancing the Growth and Yield of Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) in Hydroponic System Using Magnetized Irrigation Water,"agriculture, magnetized water, irrigation, growth, lettuce, hydroponic system",Shirly O. Agcaoili,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.02.02,"The application of magnetic technology to agricultural productions is considered new breakthroughs to the enhancement of food production. However, studies about its application on the hydroponic system of production on high valued crops are limited. Hence, the present study assessed the effect of magnetically-treated water on the growth and yield parameters of lettuce in hydroponic system. Magnetic device with different number of permanent magnets was used to magnetize irrigation water in the hydroponic system. Uniform and healthy seedlings are transplanted and arranged completely randomized design. Magnetically treated water enhanced the growth and yield parameters of lettuce such as weekly height, leaf area, fresh weight, and root length. The height, leaf area, fresh weight, and root length increased up to 44.30%, 199.93%, 50.72%, and 37.00%, respectively vs. the control. Results revealed that magnetic treatment for water in hydroponic system has potentials to increase the growth of lettuce and consequently its yield.","Agrawal, P & Jacob, S (2010).

Rainforestation and Sustainable Development: From the Lens of the Four Individual Adopters from the Visayas Region in the Philippines,"environment conservation, economic, environmental and social benefits","Guiraldo C. Fernandez, Marlito Jose M. Bande",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.02.03,"Rainforestation (RF) is a reforestation strategy designed to address the problem of dwindling Philippine forest landscapes by planting native trees to unproductive and idle lands. It was introduced in the early 1990â€™s to ensure that forests only have species that are endemic in the country. Using the method of hermeneutic phenomenology, this paper concludes that the Philippine indigenous tree species have enhanced the viability of Rainforestation as a major conservation strategy in the Philippines as compared to the exotic trees used by the government in the 1970s and 1980s and therefore, is very significant in promoting biodiversity and sustainable development.","Asio, V.

Catholic Identity and Spiritual Well-Being of Students in a Philippine Catholic University,"religious education, catholic identity, spiritual well-being, college students, catholic university, Philippines","Enrique G. Oracion, Dennis V. Madrigal",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.02.04,"This paper primarily compares the spiritual well-being of students in a Catholic university classified according to their self-ascribed identity as creative and orthodox Catholics. With the use of a survey questionnaire, the demographic and academic profile and church involvement of students were first established and subsequently associated with their self-ascribed Catholic identity using Chi-square test. Meanwhile, the spiritual wellbeing of students was measured using the standardized 20-item Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS) test developed by Paloutzian and Ellison (1982). The t-test and one-way Analysis of Variance were employed to differentiate the spiritual well-being scores of students grouped according to their demographic and academic profile and church involvement. This paper shows that the orthodox Catholics significantly scored higher in spiritual well-being than the creative Catholics. Thus, teaching the meanings of Catholic beliefs and practices should be enriched with practical relevance so students would consider them not merely as part of Catholic rituals.","Ammerman, N. T.

Teachersâ€™ Well-Being Through Work Engagement among Montfortian Schools in Asia,"work engagement, servant leadership, Organizational Citizenship Behavior, organizational commitment, perceived organizational support, teachersâ€™ well-being",Arul Rayan Irudayaraj,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.02.05,"The current study focuses on the well-being of Montfortian teachers in terms of work engagement in five Asian countries such as India, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. Data were collected using a survey questionnaire from 427 teachers. Differences in the level of work engagement were tested using Analysis of Variance. Regression models examined the significant predictors and organizational outcomes of work engagement. Perceived Organizational Support and Servant Leadership significantly predicted Work Engagement in Singapore and Thailand. Work Engagement had a positive impact on Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) directed toward organizations in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. It had a significant effect on OCB directed toward teachers in Malaysia and Thailand. Work Engagement also predicted Affective commitment in India and Singapore. This study produces cross-national knowledge about work
engagement. Further, it provides a better understanding of teachersâ€™ well-being in terms of work engagement and its effect on organizational variables in the school context.","Agrawal, S. (2015).

"The Caring Self: The Older Adult Care Providersâ€™ Experiences
","caring self, older adults, care agent, care providers",Daisy Palompon,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.02.06,"This study explored the meaning of the caring experiences of nurses and caregivers in a private older adult facility. Using Hermeneutic phenomenology the study interviewed ten informants and data gathered were analyzed using NVivo, a qualitative data analysis software. Findings revealed four themes: a) My mission, my passion; b) My Challenge, my victory; c) Caring beyond boundaries and d) My life, my salvation. The study concluded that the caring self of the care providers consist of three dimensions of caring: confident care, strategic care and enduring care. This became the basis in the development of a theory that states that the caring self is the foundation of all the caring experiences that enables one to become an effective care provider, otherwise known as the care agent.","Asian Development Bank.

Top Stressors among Filipino Undergraduate Students: A Multicenter - Interdisciplinary Study,"stress, mental health, stressors, coping mechanisms, undergraduate students, university students","Glynne P. Bate, Marivel B. Go, Severina P. Velos",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.02.07,"Stress has been identified as the antecedent for undesirable outcomes, such as depression and self-harm but there still lack of awareness on extent of its impact on academics most notably in a developing country like the Philippines. Thus, a multicenter and interdisciplinary study was employed on 501 students from six state universities in the Philippines. A questionnaire structured to assess the perception of the students as to the severity of identified stressors) as well as the prevalence of the coping mechanisms they adopt to overcome stress was used. The results indicated that academic stressors proved to be the main contributory factor to levels of distress among undergraduates. Educators and decision-makers should tailor regular student evaluations and programs that ensure the impediment of the sources of stress and other measures for further prevention.","Abouserie, R.
