Global Patterns in Spatial Expansion of Dengue Serotype-I in Response to Increasing Surface Temperature,"Dengue expansion, Surface temperature difference, Dengue virus serotype-1","Rhoniel Ryan Ymbong, Jake Joshua Chi Garces",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.01.01,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection (DENV serotypes 1-4) that imposes a serious health and economic burden in tropical and sub-tropical countries around the world. Increasing atmospheric temperature had changed the dynamics of the mosquito habitats and thereby influences distribution of these mosquito vectors. We examined the increase in the number of countries within the regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas reporting laboratory confirmed dengue cases caused by DENV-1 as a response to increasing global surface temperature difference. Data on the number of countries with confirmed reports of dengue (Messina et al. 2014) and surface temperature difference (General Circulation Model) were subjected to scatter plots and linear regression. There were 113 recorded countries across three regions (America=44, comprising the North and South; Africa=28; and Asia=41) reporting dengue incidence from 1943 to 2013, of which 98 countries (America=41; Africa=20; and Asia=37 with the inclusion of Australia) reported confirmed dengue cases caused by DENV-1. Findings suggest that the effect of temperature to the expansion of dengue varies dramatically in certain groups of country. Here, we explore three patterns (PAT) of expansion response where 1) continuous increase in temperature results into a continuous increase in the number of countries with dengue cases (PAT-A), 2) initial increase in temperature results into increase in the number of countries with dengue cases but subsequent increase in temperature results in the decline of dengue expansion (PAT-B), and 3) initial increase in temperature results into higher rate of dengue expansion but continued increase slows it down (PAT-C). PAT-A represented the majority of these countries, including 10 out of 11 countries in Southeast Asia. These results are in congruence with the past studies that supports dengue expansion to be temperature-dependent.","Adams, B., & Boots, M. (2010).

Melliferous Resources for Bee Forage,"Ecology, melliferous resources, bee forage, nectar, pollen, floral calendar, descriptive survey, Cagayan Valley, Philippines",Shella B. Cacatian,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.01.02,"Efficiency of beekeeping industry depends not only on honeybee strains, its management and hive structures, but also on the abundance, availability and proper utilization of bee flora around bee farming areas. The present investigation was conducted in three barangays in Northwestern Cagayan covering Culao, Sitio Nagbaranganan in Centro 2 and Balingit from March 2014 to April 2015. Â The study used a descriptive survey method to identify the diversity of melliferous resources and to develop a floral calendar in relation to pollen and nectar availability in the area. Data was analyzed using a frequency count. Â In the three vegetations sampled, 54 plant species are useful to honeybees, 27 of which are forest trees, 25 are agricultural crops, and one each is a shrub and a weed. The study ascertained 18 flowering plants as extremely important bee floras since these blossom throughout the year. March to May were identified as the honey flow periods.Â  July to September (dry season) and October to December (rainy season) were the dearth periods for honeybees in the study area. A floral calendar was developed based on the characteristics, abundance, time and duration of bloom of the bee flora. Â Northwestern Cagayan is suitable to initiate bee farming.","Akratanakul, P.

Various Trends on the National Development of Renewable Energy Source Affecting the Natural Resource Depletion,"Renewable energy source, natural resources, exploratory pattern analysis, country trends",Eduardo D. Piedad Jr.,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.01.05,"Renewable energy sources are foreseen to rise as they become scarce and expensive fossil fuels. Considering this thought, each country implements different strategies and national policies to support the development of renewable sources. However, these emerging developments may contribute to its depletion of natural sources. In this paper, an exploratory pattern analysis was used on 125 selected countries to determine the underlying trends on the effect of the development of renewable energy (RE) sources while utilizing the countriesâ€™ natural resources. Due to different status of each country, the trends were grouped in similar associations such as negative, positive and bell-like relationships. Developed countries showed a negative relationship where the natural resources are heavily utilized in the early stages but rapidly decreased as the RE progresses. This reflects the capability of these countries with high to very-high human development index (HDI) to invest more on advanced technologies which utilize fewer natural resources. On the other hand, the underdeveloped countries with low to moderate HDI behave in a positive relationship showing their heavily dependence on its natural resources as RE progresses. Moreover, a group of developing countries between developed and underdeveloped categories and without direct relationship to HDI showed a transition between positive to negative transition as the RE progresses.

These findings support the international policymakers, developers and investors on RE market justifications and entrustments, and fair RE policies such as the integration of Carbon Footprint Policy.","Bull, S. R. (2001). Renewable Energy Today and Tomorrow. In PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE (Vol. 89).

Displacement and Illumination Levels Effect on Short-distance Measurement Errors of Using a Camera,"short-distance measurement error, camera-to-lens displacement, illumination, computer vision, camera, descriptive and comparative analysis","Eduardo D. Piedad Jr., Ricky B. Villeta",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.01.06,"Using a camera for measurement reading is simplified through the incorporation of computer vision application. The variations in the environmentâ€™s setting, however, may constitute to the occurrence of measurement errors. A study investigated the significant effect of changing the camera-to-lens displacements and the variations of the illumination level on the short-distance measurement reading. This is performed initially by developing an actual setup calibrated though the comparison with the hypothesized values. Then, an experiment on this calibrated setup generates the measurement results of varying the displacement positions and the illumination levels. Through descriptive and comparative statistical analysis, there is evidence that the variations of the displacement alone do not significantly change the measurement results. Similarly, the variations in the illumination levels do not also constitute significant changes on the measurement results. Hence, each of the variables bears no contribution on the occurrence of the measurement error of using camera. It is further confirmed through the two way analysis of variance that there is no significant difference on the displacement positions and illumination levels, and on their interactions. These results verified that a camera can be used as a short-distance measurement tool adequately regardless on the object-to-lens displacement positions and on the illumination levels.","Abaya, W.

Government Effectiveness and Corruption Control to the Global Competitiveness Level of ASEAN Countries,"path analysis, government effectiveness, global competitiveness, corruption control, human development, enabling trade facilitation",Herben M. Tautho,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.01.07,"This study is a validation of the varied parameters of global competitiveness level of the ASEAN countries. Government effectiveness (GE) and corruption control (CC) are the direct predictors and independent variables while global competitiveness (GC) is the response variable. The determined causal factors affected by government effectiveness and corruption control are human development (HD) and enabling trade facilitation (ETF) which have varied impacts to global competitiveness. The researcher utilized a path analysis where 6 path models were established from the predictors (x) to its response variable (y) to determine which among these factors creates a huge impact. Path coefficients were generated and the summation of value effects was determined. Findings revealed that government effectiveness and corruption control were substantial elements that influenced the dynamism and vitality of global competitiveness landscape. However, GE has a strong direct effect to GC as compared to CC and from amongst the indirect effects, the correlation between GE and HD relative to GC has the highest path coefficient. The existing economic and political conditions of the individual ASEAN member countries reflected by the implications of the raw data collected are seen as an impediment to a more collective performance. Hence, this study implies a two-fold re-evaluation and strengthening of the policy formulation and implementation individually and collectively as a regional bloc.","Amadeo, K., (2017).

The â€œResurrection of the Fleshâ€ according to Saint Augustine,NA,"Jose Rene C. Delariarte, OSA",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.01.09,"This paper argues that contrary to some critics, Augustine, the philosopher and pillar of the Catholic faith, did tackle resurrection [of the flesh or body] by examining some of his writings. The author traces the development of Augustineâ€™s interpretation of the resurrection of the body by examining the context and some texts in four of his works, namely, De fide et symbolo, Opus imperfectum contra Julianum, De Catechizandis Rudibus, and the Enchiridion . The researcher investigates further on: (a) Augustineâ€™s understanding of the â€œresurrection of the fleshâ€ in the Creed, (b) the developmental understanding of â€œresurrection of the fleshâ€ from the different representative texts enumerated above, and (c) the theological conclusion that one could infer from the investigation whether or not it is in consonance with the present understanding of Augustine and the present formulation as theologically accepted in the present time.","Augustinus, A. & Christopher, J.

Screening Indicators for an Improved Faculty Accomplishment,"faculty accomplishment, screened indicators, improved accomplishment, pca on achievement, ipoo on faculty accomplishment","Juanita M Costillas, Melvin E. Obus, Flordeliza E. Vitor",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.01.10,"This study determined the indicators for an improved faculty accomplishment based on selected profile (age, the number of years of teaching, performance rating, and salary), Common Criteria for Evaluation or CCE (educational qualification, professional achievements, and academic experience) and Qualitative Contribution Evaluation (QCE) ratings. One hundred percent (160) of faculty with ratings in the NBC- 461 6th cycle comprised the respondent which was evidently adequate as sample based on Kaiserâ€“Meyerâ€“Olkin (KMO) results. The Bartlettâ€™s test of sphericity indicates that variables are well-defined for Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The pre-defined indicators were categorized as indexes labeled as Input-Process-Output-Outcome. Results show that change in the Outcome of HE varies depending on the variables involved in the analysis. Considering full data, data with QCE and data of senior faculty, Inputs, Processes, and Outputs significantly contribute towards an improved (Outcome) faculty accomplishment (FA). The analysis on junior faculty (JF), showed that only Inputs and Outputs were significantly affecting change on Outcome of HE. Moreover, the most significantly affecting indicators towards faculty accomplishments are performance rating, age, and number of years of teaching. Then educational qualification followed, next are professional achievement and academic experience, and lastly the QCE.","Al-Hussami M., Saleh M.Y.N. ,Abdalkader R.H. & Mahadeen, A.I. (2011).
