Socio-Economic Indicators of Coastal Resource Management Participation: The Bataan Case,"Coastal Resource Management, Coastal Zone Management, Integrated Coastal Resource Management, Environmental Management, Bataan",Adrian D. Perdio,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1806.02.01,"Recognizing the human dimension on participation to environmental conservation initiatives, this study determined the socio-economic characteristics of stakeholders in Bataan Coastal Resource Management (CRM) and how these variables influence their participation in the process. Data were collected through a survey. Four variables revealed to be independent indicators of high or poor CRM participation: the stakeholdersâ€™ locality income class, age, level of education, and household size. These indicators are important matters to cogitate for they are indirect drivers of the success or failure of CRM activities. It is concluded that Bataan CRM in the Philippines needs to be reviewed to tackle socio-economic barriers to engagement. Assessment of the process of selecting Bataan CRM participants; strengthened information, education, and communication component through an enriched content and rationalized delivery; institution of a unified CRM database system; and establishment of a provincial CRM research center are all recommended to counteract stakeholder estrangement and unresponsiveness to CRM efforts.","Ablong, W.

Energy Conservation in Academic Institutions: An Application of Theory of Planned Behavior,"Energy conservation, Theory of planned behavior, antecedents of user behavior",Eugenio A. Ermac,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1806.02.02,"Energy conservation is a buzzword that cuts across a broad spectrum of stakeholders. It has been widely practiced, developed, and discussed in government, political, and industrial sectors due to its massive impact on tackling issues related to climate change and global warming as well as presenting opportunities to cut energy costs. Despite the active discussion of this topic in the literature, very few papers have discussed it in the context of academic institutions which has one of the most significant impacts in terms of energy consumption. To address the issue, this paper places the topic of energy conservation in the context of academic institutions. Moreover, it adopts the Theory of Planned Behavior to investigate the success of energy conservation initiatives in academic institutions by looking at user behavior and its antecedents. Finally, this paper contributes significantly to the literature as it is one of the very few papers and arguably the first to discuss energy conservation in the context of academic institutions using the Theory of Planned Behavior. Furthermore, this paper will be beneficial for practitioners and other stakeholders in that it provides them with a framework to investigate the success of implementing energy conservation initiatives, especially, in academic institutions by looking at the antecedents of user behavior.","Alfaris, F., Juaidi, A., &amp; Manzano-Agugliaro, F.

Ricoeurâ€™s Hermeneutics: Transforming Political Structures into Just Institutions through the Critical Appropriation of Political Power,"Ricoeur, hermeneutics, political power, political vigilance, reflection",Alexis Deodato S. Itao,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1806.02.03,"In this paper, I aim to show that the critical appropriation of political power can be a potential tool in transforming political structures into just institutions. To achieve this aim, I employ Ricoeurâ€™s hermeneutics of symbols because in his different political essays, he consistently regards political power as akin to a symbol. Thus, for him, the critical appropriation of political power requires a hermeneutical procedure. And so in my discussion, I devote one section for Ricoeurâ€™s hermeneutics of symbols, one for his thoughts on political power, and another one for the critical appropriation of political power through the hermeneutics of symbols. To put Ricoeurâ€™s political and hermeneutical thoughts in a better light, I introduce these sections with a separate section on his philosophical anthropology. In my conclusion, I affirm that transforming political structures into just institutions is very much possible through the critical appropriation of political power. It is such a potential tool in effecting these transformations because the critical appropriation of political power involves a hermeneutical procedure that follows a three-step process of reflection. And reflection, which makes way for the critical appropriation of political power, is what ensures that power rests only in the hands of those who are more likely to advance the common good, resulting into a greater possibility for the transformation of political structures into just institutions.","Akrivoulis, D.

Geographic Information System-Based Suitability Analysis for Potential Shallow Tube-Well Irrigation Development,"shallow tube-well, irrigation development, geographic information system (GIS), suitability mapping, Isabela, Philippines",Shirly O. Agcaoili,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1806.02.04,"This study developed a geographic information system (GIS)-based decision support system in the spatial identification of a viable location for shallow tube-well irrigation development in the province of Isabela. Factors such as slope, soil type; land cover and groundwater depth were used as input parameters. Around 98% of the existing shallow tube-wells were within the suitable area. The developed map was validated using existing irrigated areas. Results show that more than 377,000 hectares were found potentially suitable locations for shallow tube-well irrigation development. These areas are characterized with a water table depth of <6.5 m, a slope of<18%, soil textures (sandy loam, clay loam, and sandy clay). Sufficient factors in combination with the GIS tool is a great tool to carry out spatial data in land-use analysis and the use of this as a means in identifying viable locations for shallow tube-well irrigation development in other places is reliable.","Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Act of the Philippines (AFMA law) Retrieved from https://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1997/ra_8435_1997.html

An Analytic Approximation to the Density of Twin Primes,"twin primes, inter-arrival time","Dionisel Y. Regalado, Rodel Azura",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1806.02.05,"The highly irregular and rough fluctuations of the twin primes below or equal to a positive integer x     are considered in this study. The occurrence of a twin prime on an interval [0,x] is assumed to be random. In particular, we considered the waiting time between arrivals of twin primes as approximated by a geometric distribution which possesses the discrete memory-less property. For large n, the geometric distribution is well-approximated by the exponential distribution. The number of twin primes less or equal to x will then follow the Poisson distribution with the same rate parameter as the exponential distribution. The results are compared with the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture on the frequency of twin primes. We successfully demonstrated that for large n, the proposed model is superior to the H-L conjecture in predicting the frequency of twin primes.","Azura, R. B., Tarepe, D. A., Borres, M.
