Auditors’ Professional Skepticism and Its Relationship with Their Thinking Styles,"thinking styles, professional skepticism, Philippines , sociodemographic attributes, auditors","Teovy Erdel Bongcales, Ariel Balunan, Loriemar Igot, Jurienel Mae Laude, JJ Jycka Mojados, Kristine June Uy",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.02.04,"The complexity of financial reporting highlights the need for professional skepticism among auditors. This study examined the relationship between auditors’ professional skepticism (PS) and thinking styles (TS) and explored what associations exist among PS, TS, and auditors’ sociodemographic attributes. Using snowball sampling, we surveyed 139 auditors in the Philippines using the Thinking Styles Inventory – Revised II and the Professional Skepticism Scale. Confirmatory analysis using Kendall’s tau-B showed a strong correlation between PS and TS I (creativity-generating style), implying that it plays a prominent role in professional skepticism. Contrary to earlier studies, our study found only a moderate correlation between TS II (norm-favoring style) and PS. The k-Modes clustering algorithm revealed that auditors showing high PS were low-ranking, less-experienced licensed female CPAs in firms with global affiliations and manifesting creative-generating TS. These findings add to the accounting profession’s understanding of PS and may be of valuable help in cultivating PS among auditors.","Acampado, A. G., & Pajares, G. G. (2021).

The Determinants of Fake News Adaptation during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Social Psychology Approach,"adaptation, collectivism, social support, social endorsement, perceived credibility, issue involvement","Choon Ling Kwek, Ke Shin Yeow, Li Zhang, Kay Hooi Keoy, Genaro Japos",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.02.05,"Because of COVID-19, people have felt the social distance and have resorted to the internet for information needs. Hence, fake news has become prevalent as people rely on information explored online. This research aims to examine the social-cultural impacts of fake news adaptation behavior from the social psychological perspective by investigating the relationship between collectivism, social support, sense of belonging, social endorsement, fear of missing out, perceived credibility, issue involvement, and adaptation on fake news among young adults in Malaysia. A quantitative research approach with an online self-administered survey was conducted, and 451 responses were obtained through snowball sampling. In the data analysis, measurement and structural equation modeling were adopted. Findings showed that the relationships among adaptation behaviors on fake news were significantly supported. This research consummates the understanding of the influences of social-cultural (collectivism) on the judgment formation of adaptation among internet users on fake news.","Akbar, Z., Toma, I., Garcia, J.

Deriving a Formula in Solving Reverse Fibonacci Means,"fibonacci sequence , reverse fibonacci sequence, Binet’s formula, means","Steven Elizalde, Romeo Patan",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.02.03,"Reverse Fibonacci sequence $\{J_n\}$ is defined by the relation $J_n = 8(J_{n-1} - J_{n-2})$ for $n\geq2$ with $J_0=0$ and $J_1=1$ as initial terms. A few formulas have been derived for solving the missing terms of a sequence in books and mathematical journals, but not for the reverse Fibonacci sequence. Thus, this paper derived a formula that deductively solves the first missing term $\{x_1\}$ of the reverse Fibonacci sequence and is given by the equation

$x_1=\frac{b+8aJ_n}{J_{n+1}}$.

By using the derived formula for $\{x_1\}$, it is now possible to solve the means of the reverse Fibonacci sequence as well as solving the sequence itself.","Janičko, O. (2018).

A digital card system (DCS) with a quick response (QR) code payment was utilized to facilitate the disbursement of financial assistance and to enable real-time monitoring of the program beneficiaries’ expenditure transactions. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the DCS, investigating how the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and attitude towards its use have influenced the actual use and satisfaction of the DCS use by the beneficiaries. The research, a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods, was participated by 212 beneficiaries through face-to-face surveys. With the Technology Acceptance Method (TAM) as the study’s framework, the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) results show that the DCS is evaluated as useful and easy to use and satisfied the beneficiaries.","Ali, S., Poulova, P., Akbar, A., Javed, H.

Susada",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.02.07,"To promote financial inclusivity while being responsive to technology demands, the Philippine government implemented a framework that requires banks to improve and innovate their payment systems. The introduction of the National Retail Payment System raises the question of whether the aim of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in advancing digital financial inclusion significantly impacts the financial stability of universal and commercial banks. This correlational study examines the impact of digital financial inclusion on bank stability utilizing principal component analysis and linear regression analysis from a dataset of 19 universal and commercial banks from 2017 to 2019. Findings showed that a higher level of digital financial inclusion is associated with higher banking stability for Philippine universal and commercial banks. While the results support the study hypothesis of a positive relationship between the two (2) variables, the statistical significance cannot be guaranteed at the outset of this analysis due to the limited number of years examined.","Achieng, O.

"The Tuba Culture in Leyte, Philippines","tuba culture, fermented wine, values formation, oral history",Sheldon Ives G. Agaton,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.02.01,"This research work centers on the culture of tuba, a fermented drink primarily composed of coconut sap and barok. This drink is commonly found in the province of Leyte, Philippines. Utilizing oral history coupled with related studies from reputable journals, this paper presents tuba as a beverage common and perfected in the province of Leyte, hence forms part Leyte's tangible culture. Further, this liquor, being a commodity, can be a source of income on the part of the mananggiti, the alpor, and anyone who wishes to sell it. This paper also narrates how tuba is valued as part of Leyte's culture, and tries to understand how tuba nurtures certain Filipino values. This paper concludes that this liquor is essential to the province's culture, hence, worthy to be documented and perpetuated by highlighting the need to elevate the value of the mananggiti.","Agaton, S.

Symbolic Actions of Cultural Characters in Davao Folk Narratives,"symbolic actions, cultural characters, folk narratives, Davao, Philippines","Angelo Lenard E. Yu, Joanna Z. De Catalina",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.02.02,"This study mirrors the symbolic actions of cultural characters in Davao folk narratives. It utilized descriptive-narrative and narrative-conversational methods to collect and analyze the folk narratives in the Davao region. The Cultural Symbolism theory of Clifford Geertz was used to reveal the interweaving culture of the indigenous people. Thus, the symbolic actions present in the texts are the following: pangayaw (tribal war), divine intervention, hunting, trading, belief in the existence of heaven, usage of magical instruments, cursing and casting enchantments, and patronizing a Datu. Hence, this study contributes to the preservation of culture which is slowly vanishing due to the effects of colonization, modernization, and globalization. Thus, further studies on myths, folktales, folk songs, folk speeches, and folk epics should be done to promote the cultural awareness among postmodern Filipinos.","Aleria, J. R. A. (2020).
