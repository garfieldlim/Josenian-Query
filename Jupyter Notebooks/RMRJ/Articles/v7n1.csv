The Quality of Recoletos Education in Negros Island in the Realm of Philippine Catholic School Standards,"Catholic Education, Recollect Schools, Philippine Catholic School Standards, Descriptive-Correlational, Negros Island","Dennis V. Madrigal, Enrique G. Oracion",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.01.01,"This descriptive-correlational study assesses the level of quality of Catholic education of five Recollect schools in Negros Island as assessed by school personnel and what they had done according to the framework of the Philippine Catholic School Standards (PCSS). Also, it determines whether a significant relationship exists between the demographic profile of the school personnel and their quality assessment in order to test the hypothesis that variation in their age, length of service, school origin and designation influence their respective assessments. Using the PCSS Survey Questionnaire, the data were analyzed using mean, Spearman rho, and chi-square. The findings reveal that the level of quality of Catholic education in Recollect schools exceeds the benchmark. Significant inverse relationship was found between between age and length of service of school personnel and their Catholic education quality assessment. However, no significant relationship was found between school of origin and designation and their quality assessment.","Almayo, E. (2017). Exploring the brand experience

An Investigation on the Intralocality Differences in Health and Safety Implementation of Construction Industries,"health and safety, construction industry, intralocality differences","Rino Anthony M. Demeterio, Rosein A. Ancheta Jr., Lanndon A. Ocampo, Dennis L. Capuyan, Reylan G. Capuno",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.01.02,"Generally, the status of health and safety in the construction sector is reported to be declining. Consequently, this indicates the necessity of developing an awareness and a comprehensive knowledge among the role of various stakeholders in their contribution to construction health and safety improvement. As part of the construction industry stakeholders, the role of localities is one of the factors to consider in the formation of construction health and safety knowledge and practice. Despite the plethora of construction health and safety studies found in the literature, there have been very few studies that have considered the association between localities and their association with construction health and safety practices. In this paper, a Chi-square test of independence is used to investigate whether a disparity between localities and their safety practices exists. Moreover, this study contributes to existing literature in such a way that it is the first to consider the relationship between intra-locality and health and safety practices in the context of the construction industry. Furthermore, this study will be valuable for construction stakeholders in the formulation of a more unified and standardized health and safety practices and regulations.","Al-Kaabi, N., & Hadipriono, F.

"Development and Performance Evaluation of an Indirect Heat Copra Dryer with Phase Changer
A Comparison with Kiln Drying and Open Sun Drying of Copra","thermal efficiency, solar radiation, moisture content, fired dryer, copra grading","Marvin C. Credo, Rommel T. Valmoria",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.01.03,"In the Philippines, farming communities produce copra using traditional open sun drying method that could be severely affected by heavy rainfall, temperature change, and intermittent sunshine, which could cause high microbial infection to the product. On the other hand, kiln drying may avoid these circumstances. However, smoke deposits in the finished product still cause farmers to have low-quality grade copra. Keeping this in view, an indirect heat copra dryer with phase changer (IHCDPC) was designed, fabricated, and evaluated in the hopes of providing farmers an alternative approach in drying copra, which may yield to producing a high-quality grade product. The developed IHCDPC was able to reduce the moisture content in fresh coconut meat from 57.4% w.b. to about 7.2% w.b. for a drying time of twenty-five hours. The IHCDPC was found out to have a thermal efficiency of 30.87%. The copra produced were graded as 84% MGC1, 13% MGC2, and 3% MGC3.","Ayyappan, S & Mayilsamy, K. (2010). Experimental

Assessing Applicant Employability Using Social Media for Talent Acquisition and Recruitment in IT/BPM Companies,"social media, background check, cyber-vetting, character assessment",Jovelyn C Cuizon,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.01.04,"The study aims to assess the extent of social media usage in talent acquisition in IT/BPM companies in Cebu and evaluate the insights of the applicants on the practice of using social media in character assessment for hiring decision. The quantitative method was employed to obtain data from two groups of respondents which constitute thirty hiring managers and ninety-six applicants. The study found that while hiring managers moderately practice social media background check to obtain additional information about the applicant, they seldom used it in hiring decisions because of the lack of formal or informal policy allowing or restricting the use of social media for that purpose. It is also found that there is a significant difference in perception between hiring managers and prospective applicants on usergenerated content on candidate social media profile.","Abate, D.

Toxicity Evaluation and Anthelminthic Property of Cebu Cinnamon (Cinnamomum cebuense Kosterm.)

Picardal",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.01.05,"Cinnamomum cebuense (Kosterm.) is widely known as stomachache remedy, but adverse reaction to varying amount of herbal extract has also been reported, thus, requiring toxicity-profiling studies. Here, the toxicity of C. cebuense leaf extract (CCLE) was evaluated using brine shrimp lethality assay (BSLA) and anthelminthic assay under a complete randomized design with equal replications. Results in BSLA revealed an LC50 value of 7.05 Î¼g/ml (pâ‰¤0.05) which is considerably medium-toxic based on standard toxicity criterion. Influence on earthworm activity showed significant difference (pâ‰¤0.01) among the different concentrations of the extract (100 mg/ml, 75 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, and 25 mg/ml) following a concentration-dependent response trend. Results suggest strong toxicity against earthworms at 75â€“100 mg/ml while having a moderate to weak toxicity at 25â€“50mg/ml. Both assays were able to elucidate toxicity of CCLE which may be due to the presence of cinnamaldehyde, the main phytochemical found in cinnamon leaves. CCLE is toxic at elevated dosages and thus warrants parallel studies using higher-vertebrate models.","Ahmed, J., Sultana N., Dewan S.M.R., Amin, M.N.

Understanding Sex Differences in Depressive Symptomatology Among Malaysian Adolescents,"adolescents, depressive symptoms, parental verbal aggression, sex, stressful life events","Sharisse May M. Barra, Rozumah Baharudin, Nor Sheereen Zulkefly, Amira Najiha Yahya, Zainal Madon",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.01.06,"Depressive symptomatology is among the major psychological problems experienced by adolescents. Sex differences in the occurrence of depressive symptoms have likewise been extensively reported in literature. However, a great majority of related research have primarily been carried out in the Western context. Hence, we conducted a study to identify the prevalence of depressive symptoms among Malaysian adolescents, and to determine its relationship with certain risk factors as well as the potential moderating role of sex. The sample comprised 964 adolescents from 20 secondary schools across Malaysia. Using logistic regression, results demonstrated that stressful life events and maternal verbal aggression significantly predicted symptoms of depression. In the moderation tests, sex significantly interacted with stressful life events and parental verbal aggression in predicting depressive symptoms. Hence, there is evidence to suggest that the depressogenic impact of stressful life events and parental verbal aggression on depressive symptomatology differs between male and female adolescents.","Agoston, A.
