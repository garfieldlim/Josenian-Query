Multidimensional Poverty Indicators in light of ASEAN Integration,"Poverty, ASEAN, ASEAN Integration","Jayvee Faust B. Anga, Jonah Marie S. Enerlas, Kristine June D. Uy, Marjurie Lourince E. Zanoria",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.01,"This study aimed to explore poverty among ASEAN member nations by introducing a multidimensional poverty index that can be used to determine the relative success of a country in deterring several deprivations that are identified and measured. It utilized multiple factors that can be useful for policy and investment decisions and are intended to complement analyses using financial poverty indicators. Using exploratory data analysis, several indicators were selected to represent the different dimensions of poverty. Said indicators were then subjected to factor analysis which yielded four multidimensional indices namely: General Welfare Index, Governance and Emotional Landscape Index, and Social Climate Index. Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia ranked 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in all three indices, respectively. In addition, multivariate cluster analysis was also performed. It revealed that Singapore exhibited exceptional performance in all indices, thereby earning it a cluster all to its own. Similarities were observed between Brunei and Malaysia while Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, and Indonesia were clustered together. Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar belonged to another cluster, indicating similarities among them. The study concluded that a wide gap exists among ASEAN countries in terms of the various deprivations measured. It also identified several problem areas and strengths of the ASEAN member states. This information can be helpful in making sound judgments especially in the delicate circumstances that surround economic integration.","Alkire, S., & Foster, J.

Sovereign Bankruptcy in the Perspective of the ASEAN Integration,"ASEAN, ASEAN integration, sovereign debt, sovereign bankruptcy","Yener C. Cabalida, Alessa Joy D. Cruz, Kristine June D. Uy, Marjurie Lourince E. Zanoria",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.02,"This paper recognizes the presence of sovereign debt as primary means of financing its expenditures. It practically covers the gaps between cash outflows and inflows from a countryâ€™s revenues such as those coming from taxes. However, when a countryâ€™s debt goes too high that it already has difficulty in paying it off, sovereign bankruptcy occurs. This study dwells at the factors that lead to sovereign bankruptcy among ASEAN countries in terms of business confidence, credit management, resource availability and market stability. To measure the indicators in determining the nations in the verge of being bankrupt, the researchers use the data depicting the corruption perception index, GDP and investment climate index. Furthermore, data regarding the ease of doing business rankings, credit ratings, surplus/deficit of the government budget, external debt, current account balance and inflation rate are also considered. These indicators are believed to be suggestive of a countryâ€™s capability of sustaining its overall debt, highlighting the point that an ASEAN country should take into account all its resources to ensure that it doesnâ€™t go bankrupt as a nation especially now that it is looking into integrating itself into one economic ASEAN community.","Association of Southeast Asian Nations (2013).Inflation rate, year-on-year change of the consumer price index, end of periodÂ (Annually ; Quarterly).

Path Analysis of Climate and Tourism to the Economic Growth in the Philippines,NA,Helmae N. Etulle-Tapanan,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.03,"This study is an empirical validation of the economic and environmental parameters of tourism in the Philippines. The determined tourism factors to be affected by tropical depressions are: tourist arrivals, tourism employment rate and travel price. These factors had varied impacts on economic growth in terms of annual gross domestic product through: exchange rate, inflation rate, consumer price index, and employment rate. The researcher utilized a path analysis to determine which among the tourism factors had a robust effect by the tropical depression. This study also concludes the effects (both direct and indirect) of predictors to GDP. A model was established from the predictors (x) to its response (y). To demonstrate the paths from the origin to the end, a computed path coefficients were generated. The summation of value effects was determined and an effect model was established. Findings revealed that travel price factor was a prevalent element that influenced the volatility of GDP and not more on the tourist arrivals and tourism employment rate. Tourists, regardless of nationality, prefer to spend more their money, enjoy and mesmerize the natural beauty of Philippines even with the occurrence of natural disturbances. Hence, this study implies on strengthening the policy of fixed prices on travels and all in-country cost, developing more the outdoor and indoor tourism industry, the Philippines infrastructure to sustain and enhance tourism services.","Brakke, Michael (2005) â€œInternational Tourism, Demand, and GDP Implications: A Background and Empirical Analysis,â€ Undergraduate Economic Review: Vol. 1: Iss. 1, Article 2.

The Worldâ€™s Leader in the Palm Oil Industry : Indonesia,"palm oil, crude palm oil, environmental scanning","Agnes C. SequiÃ±o, Jessica M. Avenido",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.04,"Indonesia, being the world leader in the production of crude palm oil, has been successful in serving the domestic and world market with palm products and palm derivatives. The industry contributes US$17.6 billion through exports in 2012. At present, the demand for crude palm oil has soared high due to the increasing awareness of the varied uses of palm oil. The challenge to countries cultivating oil palm is how to cope with the local and global demand .The focus now is to increase plantation areas to produce a higher volume of crude oil to serve the needs of the world market. Today, the total land area planted to oil palm in Indonesia has reached 9.7 million hectares. This study used data mining and Delphi technique. Data were sourced from public domain websites and several databases. This study determined the gap between production and utilization and to provide information to existing industry players ,policy makers, future investors, and would-be entrants to the industry on the latest trends noting the fast development of the industry not only in Indonesia but also in other Southeast Asian countries. Although Indonesia has been successful in providing the local and international market with palm oil products and palm derivatives, it has to benchmark with other palm producing countries to avoid industry stagnation and to intensify diversification particularly in the development of new edible products to take advantage of the health benefits derived from the use of palm oil.","Aghalino, S.O.

This simulation model aims to predict the number of customers who would continually patronize the business in spite of the premium. It is worth noting that the buyerâ€™s willingness and awareness should form part of the picture.

Cuarto,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.07,"The paper aimed to devise an alternative algorithm for solving system of linear
congruences. This algorithm is an extension of the algebraic algorithm which is an alternative method for finding solutions in linear congruences. The basic idea of the technique is to convert the given linear congruences into linear equations and solve them algebraically. The advantage of this algorithm is the simplicity of its computations and its applicability to systems of linear congruences where the conditions of the Chinese Remainder Theorem that the moduli m1â€¦mn should be pairwise coprime is not satisfied. Some illustrative examples are given to show validity of this method for solving system of linear congruences.","Adams, D.G.(2010). Distinct Solutions of Linear Congruences.

Disrupting Education: Which between technological innovations and the â€˜incredulity towards metanarrativesâ€™ is disrupting education?,"disruptions, disruptive innovation, critical theory, pedagogy, OBE, postmodernism, post-structuralism",Jose D. Velez Jr.,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.08,"According to Clayton Christensenâ€™s Disruptive Innovation Theory, upstarts eat up
market share often with innovative and more affordable products and soon become the new market leader. Christensen sees its relevance in many aspects of human endeavor including in education. Cheaper online education is said to be disruptive of colleges offering expensive classroom-based modes of instruction. This concern was highlighted in a forum held in Russia and attended by education leaders around the globe. Other scholars, however, dispute this. For them, it is the interruptions to the totalizing attempt of most scholarships and not the impact of technological innovations that is disrupting education. This paper supports this view, especially from the standpoint of developing countries long shackled by western-oriented paradigms.","Books

Evolutionary Models for the Interaction of the Higher Education Labor Force and Higher Education Market,"HEIs, Higher education graduates, global labor market, market configuration, Evolution","Mark S. Borres, Felix M. Diano Jr.",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.09,"The higher education market portends to be a huge market in the future that traditional systems of delivery of services will be insufficient. This paper proposes a model that links two (2) global markets: the higher education market and the labor market, as dramatic changes are taking place in the 21st century. A modeling and simulation strategy has been employed in this paper predicting the impact of higher education market to the labor market. Results indicated that with the rapid expansion of the Higher Education(HE) market, the size of the higher education labor force will inevitably expand.The labor market tolerates a maximum expansion capacity for HE graduates beyond which the excess HE graduates will bifurcate into two (2) channels of productive sector, namely: (a) the creation of new economies or (b) the integration of HE graduates into the skilled labor force. This dynamics necessarily yields a highly fragmented labor force configuration. In essence, the evolution of the labor market is a replica of Darwinâ€™s Biological Theory of Evolution where only the fittest will survive, i.e. evolution through mutation and adaptation whose equivalent concepts in this setting are â€œinnovationâ€ and â€œadaptationâ€ respectively. It is well-established in Evolutionary Biology that â€œmutationâ€ is the shortest-route to evolution and so we posit that â€œinnovationâ€ is the shortest route to the labor market evolutionary ladder.Therefore, a good university must be able to produce graduates who are innovative and adaptive at the same time to survive in a competitive labor market.","Barshay, Jill (4 August 2014). â€œReflections on the underemployment of college graduatesâ€.

Tourism and Hospitality Management Students undergoing US Work and Travel Program: A Phenomenological Inquiry,"International Internship, international placement, on-line media, computer-mediated conferencing, internship experiences","Steven N. Sasam, Gelena N. Asis-Dimpas, Antoniette Dayagbil",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.11,"Tourism professionals expect universities to produce graduates who could deliver and perform functions based on industry standards. Universities have long integrated International Placements to heighten student competencies, bridge the gap between theoretical awareness and industry practice, and meet the expectations of the practitioners. However, there have been reports of unfavorable encounters of students on placement abroad such as being homesick, feeling out of place, and difficulty in reconciling expectation-reality gaps. These are the key issues that hinder students from optimizing international exposure programs and compromise the quality of their learning. A phenomenological study was used to examine the lived experiences of the tourism and hospitality management students on international placement. An in-depth interview was conducted as the primary source of data collection. The data were coded and analyzed according to the research questions. The research resulted in three (3) major themes which emerged out of the experiences shared by the student interns: 1.) struggles experienced in foreign country; 2.) skills/strategies to cope with the adversities; 3.) interns communication practices. The results of this study served as the basis in enhancing the e monitoring support system for the internship coordinator in the home university.","Aiello, J. R., & Svec, C. M. (1993).

Insights of Conflict Management Strategies from the Perspectives of Selected Philosophers,NA,Glenn G. Pajares,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.12,"This study aims to draw insights and implications on conflict management strategies from selected philosophers. It utilizes textual or content analysis to present and explain what they have to say and offer about conflict management strategies. The study shows that different philosophers have varied approaches and strategies to conflict management among them are yielding, compromising, collaborating, competing, and avoiding. However, they share commonalities such as the discernment and defense of the greater good/common good over individual interests and desires; the discernment and defense of truth, rectitude, and justice over beliefs, feelings, opinions, prejudices, injustice and stereotypes; the principle of not harming others; a preventive approach to conflict management rather than curative. Therefore, philosophy is not something
abstract but offers practical strategies to manage conflict. The study is relevant because it is an additional literature on conflict management particularly from the perspective of philosophy considering that there is dearth in the literature. This study recommends that another study be made using different set of philosophers. Also, one may look into leadership or management styles reflected in the philosophy of selected philosophers.","Abel, Donald (2005). Fifty Readings Plus an Introduction to Philosophy.

Simulation Model for the Maintenance of Government and Private Facilities in the Philippine Context,"simulation model, facilities, maintenance, motivation","Jesse S. Susada, Marisa A. Mahilum, Dionisel Y. Regalado",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.14,"The contrasting practices of private and public institutions affect individuals motivation to work on the maintenance of its facilities. This paper attempts to develop a model that could predict how many years a facility (private or government) would last based on the given number of assumptions and random data. The study used an experimental design using simulation modeling. Assumptions were formulated to measure different variables. Findings revealed that government facilities tend to deteriorate faster compared to its private counterparts. Government facilities would only last approximately up to six (6) years then reach its critical level. This is due to the assumption that only 40% of government institutions are effective workers. Low percentage of effective workers would translate to less motivation of the worker to pursue any transaction that could possibly help the current state of the facility. On the other hand, more than half of the Private facilities would last more than five years before reaching a critical level. This is due to the assumption that private workers are 20% higher compared to government workers in terms of percentage of effective workers. A highly motivated worker will always be willing to spend time, even extra time, to perform his job. Benign neglect of a less motivated workforce would result to non performance of his assigned task. Therefore, increasing the level of motivation of an employee is the primordial concern of every organization whether private or public because an increase of well motivated and effective workforce would encourage everyone to help maintain and to extend the life of every facility.","Arrowsmith, (2003). â€œTransparency in government procurement: The objectives of regulation and the boundaries of the World Trade Organization.â€ Journal of World Trade 37.2: 283-303.

Ethanolic extracts of Persia americana (avocado), Psidium guajava (guava), and Moringa olifera (malunggay) were tested using the paper disc diffusion method for antibacterial agent against the common poultry pathogens Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Guava and avocado extract showed almost all the secondary metabolites screened while only flavonoids and alkaloids were present in the malunggay extract. The presence of secondary metabolites applied to broiler chicks as feed additives enhances the growth performance of the chicken. There were five treatments groups identified as distilled water,Vetracin, avocado decoction, guava decoction, and malunggay decoction. Using a statistical analysis of one- way ANOVA and Duncanâ€™s Multiple Range Test (DMRT), final weight and the weight gained has significant differences including some body parts of the chicken while the final circumferential measurement doesnâ€™t have a significant difference. Among the treatments, guava decoction had better weight yield among the experimental medicinal leaves.Therefore, this can be an alternative substitute for antibiotics in the chicken production and one way of eliminating the use of synthetic antibiotic application is through the utilization of the natural antibiotic extract from medicinal leaves which lessen the side effect in the treated animals and consumers.","Adedeji O.S., et al.

Patac, Adriano V. Patac Jr.",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.17,"The mathematics educators are looking for innovations that remediate the errors
committed by the students in solving math problems. In seeking for solutions, we apply the Student Self â€“Assessment (SSA) method and Newman Error Analysis (NEA) method to circumvent these errors. The SSA is a strong formative educational tool that enhances selfconfidence to become more independent in assessing their work. While, NEA serves as a powerful classroom diagnostic assessment to identify the skills of the students. It enables the teacher to devise and apply more appropriate teaching strategies and procedures that ignite the studentsâ€™ interest towards the subject. Out of the 179-students participating in the action research project, we discover that most of the error patterns are due to lack of understanding and transformation skills in solving word problems. With this result, the students encounter language difficulty and immature computational skills. To this end, the investigation and remediation of common math errors was a success in improving and achieving the learning goals and promotes positive behavioral changes towards the subject. The realization of these outcomes is through the inclusion of SSA and NEA. To
sustain the learning goals of the students, it should be properly facilitated to come up with a fruitful learning process.","Adediwura, A. A. (2012).
