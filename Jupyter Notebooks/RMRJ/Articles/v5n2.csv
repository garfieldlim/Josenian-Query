Disentangling the Rubrico and Dolalas Hypotheses on the Davao Filipino Language,"Davao Filipino, Rubrico Hypothesis, Dolalas Hypothesis, Theory of Communication Accommodation, Language Contact","Feorillo Petronilo A. Demeterio III, Jeconiah Louis Dreisbach",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1705.02.01,"There are two seemingly conflicting hypotheses on the status and impact of the Davao Filipino language. On one hand, Rubrico is optimistic that it could be a model variety of a more democratic and inclusive Filipino language that should be open to contributions and alterations from the other Philippine languages. On the other hand, Dolalas is giving a warning that the continued hegemony of the Tagalog/Filipino language on the Cebuano language will eventually destroy the latter. When conceptualized using the communication accommodation theory of Giles, the seemingly conflicting hypotheses would actually fit into a single construct that lines up the Cebuano language, the process of divergence, the Davao Filipino language, the process of convergence, and the Tagalog/Filipino language. Using the same communication accommodation theory, this paper assessed the validities of the two hypotheses, and attempted to formulate more acceptable hypotheses on the status and impact of the Davao Filipino language.","Albino,Y.

Evaluating Philippine Studentsâ€™ Class Participation with a Token Currency System,"token economy, class participation",Stevenson Q. Yu,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1705.02.02,"Although past studies have validated the importance of active class participation in facilitating student learning, evaluating class participation remains a major issue. This study applies a token economy system to a Philippine university by awarding token currency to students who contributed meaningfully in class. After course completion, an online survey was administered to the 65 participating students, of which there were 26 completed responses. There was no evidence that the token economy increased student performance. However, survey results, coupled with student feedback, suggest that using a token economy is a viable alternative to traditional methods of evaluating student participation.","Alexander, L.

Economic Decision across Regions of the Philippines,"multivariate analysis, economic disparity, risks taking",Joshua Edson G. Ordiz,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1705.02.03,"This study determines why Gross Regional Domestic Product per Capita (GRDP) differs across regions in the Philippines vis-Ã -vis population rate, tertiary graduate rate, and crime rate as factors. Using Minitab, it examines the secondary data sets based on every group from various regions of the country. Findings show that educated human capital converge more in highly developed areas where risks matter less and safety measures exist. This results to a concentrated high GRDP in some. It further reveals that index and non-index crime rate is not a hindrance for a person to move in the area with many opportunities as long as life is not at stake. There were more educated individuals in regions with lower GRDP; however, they practiced and worked in highly developed areas and where law is enforced, eyeing a better condition of life. By implication, it results to concentration of educated labor force in areas with better opportunities.","Aghion, P., Boustan, L., Hoxby, C., & Vandenbussche, J. (2009).

"Solid Waste Management Awareness, Attitude, and Practices in a Philippine Catholic Higher Education Institution","Attitude, Awareness, Practices, Solid Waste Management","Dennis V. Madrigal, Enrique G. Oracion",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1705.02.04,"The paper assesses the solid waste management awareness, attitude, and practices of the employees and students of a Catholic higher education institution in the Philippines. Using a descriptive research design, the data were collected using a self-administered survey questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The major findings of the study show that the respondents demonstrated a very high level of awareness and attitude and high extent of practice of solid waste management. A significant difference was found in the awareness, attitude, and practices of respondents when they were grouped according to status and religion. Also, the findings established the relationship between awareness and attitude on one hand andÂ Â  the extent of practice of solid waste management. Awareness, attitudes, and practices were significantly related to age and educational level, except for sex which showed no correlation with attitude and practices. Generally, this paper validates how knowledge influences attitude that subsequently determines behavior particularly in solid waste management as intervened by appropriate environmental education.","Adeolu, A.

The Future of Nietzscheâ€™s Perspectivism as Political Consensus,"Nietzsche, Perspectivism, Paradoxes, Political Consensus, Postmodernism",Jan Gresil Kahambing,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1705.02.05,"In this paper, I delve on Nietzscheâ€™s concept of perspectivism and how it becomes relevant amid contemporary societyâ€™s openness to relative standpoints. The foremost era that reflects this description points to postmodernism as a politics of difference. Nietzscheâ€™s perspectivism is generally a critique of the conditions that absolutize truth. While this may seem a valiant opening for a welcoming era on an epistemological standpoint, it does not however do away with its own paradoxes. I contend whether this fits well with postmodernism and its ironic relationship to truth and asserts further that the conditions for Nietzscheâ€™s perspectivism can only achieve its future if it hermeneutically stands as political consensus. Later, I will present the features of this perspectivism as political consensus and how it can be viable in postmodernity.","Abulad, R. (2004). What is Postmodernism? Abulad, R., Co, A.
