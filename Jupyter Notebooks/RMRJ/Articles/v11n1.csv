Theory of Adaptation of Educators Teaching Technology-Based Courses,"adaptation, higher education, technology-based, grounded theory",Leila Pinatil,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2311.01.08,"The need for resilience among educators has become a critical demand during the COVID-19 pandemic when in-person classes were restricted and were converted into distance learning and eventually shifted to blended learning as governments opened borders and health safety protocols eased down. Hence, this study focuses on understanding how educators of technology-based courses in public higher education across academic landscapes have navigated for continuous instructional delivery. This study utilizes the Straussian approach of Grounded Theory. This design uses a three-stage coding methodology: open, axial, and selective coding. The study generates the Theory of Educators Teaching Technology-Based Courses across academic landscapes, which postulates that educators in technology-based courses undergo phases of metamorphosis that include visioning, learning, rationalizing and doing, and modernizing, ultimately allowing them to become resilient and adaptive to the shifting landscapes of the academe caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alaidi, A.

Development and Validation of E-SelfIMo: E-Learning Self-Directed Interactive Module in Earth Science,"adaptation, higher education, technology-based, grounded theory",Nestor Jr. Lasala,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2311.01.07,"This study developed and validated E-learning Self-directed Interactive Modules (E-SelfIMo) for Earth Science. The study employed Research and Development method, using the Borg and Gall development procedure, in creating eight e-modules using Kotobee software, evaluating them by experts and students and determining their effectiveness in terms of student’s concep-tual understanding. Experts agreed that E-SelfIMo met the DepEd standards for non-printed learning materials, and students attested their high validity in content, format, and usefulness. Pretest and posttest results for the effectiveness of E-SelfIMo revealed that students exposed to the E-SelfIMo have progressed from “Near Mastery” to “Near Full Mastery” in the chosen Earth Science topics, showing more significant improvement in their conceptual understanding than the control group. This study concludes that E-SelfIMo supports interactive, active, and self-directed learning thereby, improving students’ motivation, engagement, interest, and per-formance. The E-SelfIMo could be used with technology integration as a teaching and learning tool.","Abadi, M. K., Cahya, E., Jupri, A. (2017).

Applying Stakeholder and Self-Efficacy Theories to Classify Organizational Citizenship Behavior Antecedents,"emerging nation, OCB, hospitality industry, employee-led initiatives, Cebu","Tiffany Adelaine Tan, Leahlizbeth Sia, Benedict James Duran",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2311.01.04,"Most studies about organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) focus on particular actions that employees, supervisors, or owners of organizations should exhibit. To encourage OCB in service-oriented Filipino organizations, this paper proposes a classification of OCB antecedents collected from the literature in theory and industry practice. By using the stakeholder and self-efficacy theories, the proposed four clearly defined categories point out whether these antecedents are employee-led, leader-led, organization-led, or HR-led initiatives. Since it would be burdensome for an individual to know all the factors that may influence OCB, categorizing these antecedents will help the individual to identify the behavioral aspects that he or she has control over. Managerial implications are also discussed.","Alarabiat, A., & Ramos, I. (2019). The Delphi Method in information systems research (2004-2017).

Sustainable Banking Business Model for Rural Banks in the Philippines,"sustainable banking business model, sustainability practices, financial performance, rural banks, quantitative",Jennifer B. Cabaron,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2311.01.03,"While rural banks have business strategies to generate and exploit opportunities, they also need to consider economic, social, and environmental facets for sustainability. This study used the survey approach for descriptive-correlational research involving rural banks’ eighty managers or key employees who are knowledgeable about sustainability policies. The researcher employed quantitative tools to analyze the survey's hypothesis. The associations between the variables of a research model were examined using multiple regression analysis. In addition to conducting structured surveys, the researcher examined secondary data on rural banks' financial performance from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas website. Results revealed that sustainable and sound environmental banking practices as well as their capital and loan portfolios significantly influence financial performance. Thus, the current study suggested a sustainable banking model for Philippine rural banks.","Abidin, A. F. Z., Hashim, H. A., & Ariff, A. M. (2017).

Ceballos, Erick T. Baloran, Milton Norman D. Medina",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2311.01.05,"Using primarily comparative evidence of mental health situation during the COVID-19 pandemic between a Southeast Asian and a European Country, this study was conducted among public and private schools in the Philippines and Latvia, Europe, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic utilizing a standardized Depression, Anxiety, and Stress (DAS) questionnaire. Findings revealed that Latvian teachers experienced higher cases of depression, anxiety, and stress than Filipino teachers. In contrast, Latvian students exhibit lower cases of depression and anxiety than Filipino students. Thus, mental health conditions of both teachers and students of both countries must be prioritized by conducting various programs and activities which further demands that mental health must be considered in academic institutions because when human resource knows how to deal with depression, anxiety, and stress, they also make better choices in life which will make them corollarily become even more productive at work.","Acob, J.

Bio-efficacy of Trichoderma harzianum Rifai and Botanical Extracts against Major Fungal Pathogens of Tamarind (Tamarindus indica L.) under Field Condition,"biocontrol, botanical extracts, major fungal diseases, tamarind, Philippines","Mary Grace Gatan, Aneska Bulanadi, Mary Angelica Rose Limpin, Menrado Gatan, Cesar Orpiada",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2311.01.02,"Domestic production of tamarind has decreased in the country due to diseases. Tests were made on the individual efficacy of botanical extracts like plant growth promoter (PGP) and oriental herb nutrient (OHN), as well as the Trichoderma harzianum Rifai as a possible biocontrol agent against major fungal tamarind diseases. Using Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD), a field setup was established with five treatments: untreated (negative control), synthetic fungicide, OHN, PGP, and T. harzianum having three replications per treatment. Results revealed that T. harzianum is an effective biocontrol agent against major fungal tamarind diseases. PGP having similar efficiency with T. harzianum significantly inhibited the infection and provided immediate defense from diseases. OHN is less effective due to delayed reduced infection. The research output is a significant help in the management of various diseases that is cost-effective and safe.","Abdulkadir, A., Hayatu, M., Sani, L. A., & Ahmed, H. (2022).

Modern robots can do complex tasks and are the central components of Industry 4.0. These improvements make robots applicable in a variety of fields like security, exploration, entertainment, agriculture, healthcare and industry. While advancements in robotics come with many advantages, it still faces roadblocks that hinder its development or implementation. To aid in the public acceptance and adoption of robotics in the industry, policy development is critical to minimize the social and economic effects. Several policy recommendations were made such as improved government support, wage insurance, upskilling programs, information dissemination, and robot tax, which would accelerate robotics development, bolster job security, publicize key information, and stabilize taxation.","Anagaran, J.-J.

School – Parental Engagement of Filipino Women Married to Koreans: Inputs for Policy Formulation,"school engagement , migration, multiculturalism, Filipinos abroad, policy","Inero Ancho, Sae-Hoon Park",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2311.01.01,"With the increasing number of multicultural families in Korea, opportunities and challenges arise, particularly in terms of children’s welfare and education. The present study investigates the experiences of Filipino women married to Koreans and their school parental engagement. Through unstructured interviews, 13 Filipino women participated in the study regarding their involvement in school affairs regarding their child’s attendance at Korean schools. The challenges faced by the participants were also explored. Findings show Filipino mothers’ eagerness to attend to the academic needs of their children through various programs and activities. Responsibilities and challenges faced by Filipino women span teaching their children and academic monitoring at home, despite not being fluent in Korean. Discrimination and social exclusivity have also been reported as experienced by some participants due to their multicultural backgrounds. Inputs to policy formulation have also been proposed based on the findings of the study.","Bahk, E. J. (2021, February 22). Gov’t to expand learning support for children of multicultural families.
