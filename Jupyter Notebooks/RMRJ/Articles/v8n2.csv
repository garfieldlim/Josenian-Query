"Configuration of Research Culture: Investment, Process, and Norm","research culture, teacher education, narrative inquiry",Michelle Mae Olvido,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.02.01,"Research is a priority in higher education institutions. Considering that the development of research culture is highly influenced by the paradigm by which institutions operate on, this paper sought to identify the configuration of the research culture. The researcher conducted a narrative inquiry with key informants from seven reputable teacher education institutions in Region VII and coded the interview transcripts with the aid of NVIVO 11.3.2. Using Thematic Analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006), three overarching themes on the configuration of the research culture, with its corresponding attributes and characteristics, were identified. The results showed that the research culture consists of observable and measurable inputs and outputs that interact in internal and external dynamics that are developmental and systemic, leading to standardized and contextualized practices in a teacher education institution. Therefore, research culture is an investment, a process, and a norm as it is evidence-based, dynamic, and distinct to the academic institution.","Braun, V., & Clarke, V. (2006).

The study creates a contextual chatbot named WordnetBot, a web application that utilizes the use of technologies such as Dialogflow, React, NodeJS, Javascript, and MariaDB. The Wordnet database which leverages all other dictionaries due to its semantic relations representation was used as the data source. Phrase Structure Analysis extracts the keyword and the semantic relation from a userâ€™s message or query. It complements the Machine Learning and AI capabilities of Dialogflow in the analysis.

Analysis and Forecasting of Fire incidence in Davao City,"R programming, forecasting, fire incidence, modeling for decision making","Merlito M. Villa, Roel F. Ceballos",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.02.03,"Fire incidence is a big problem for every local government unit in the Philippines. The two most detrimental effects of fire incidence are economic loss and loss of life. To mitigate these losses, proper planning and implementation of control measures must be done. An essential aspect of planning and control measures is prediction of possible fire incidences. This study is conducted to analyze the historical data to create a forecasting model for the fire incidence in Davao City. Results of the analyses show that fire incidence has no trend or seasonality, and occurrences of fire are neither consistently increasing nor decreasing over time. Furthermore, the absence of seasonality in the data indicate that surge of fire incidence may occur at any time of the year. Therefore, fire prevention activities should be done all year round and not just during fire prevention month.","Adhikari, R., & Agrawal, R. K. (2013).

Ratooning Response of Lowland Rice NSIC Rc352 (Oryza sativa L.) to Method of Nitrogen Application,"lowland rice, basal, fertilization, ratoon, topdress",Dionesio Maglahus Banoc,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.02.05,"This study seeks to determine the effect of N fertilization method on ratoon lowland rice performance, to choose a fertilization method that provides high ratooned yield, and to assess its profitability adopting N fertilization method. The experiment lays out in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications and five N fertilization methods as treatments. Method of N application significantly affected the number of days to heading and maturity, plant height, leaf area index (LAI), number of productive tillers hill-1, panicle length and weight, number of filled and unfilled grains panicle-1. This method compensates cost of production of growing ratoon crop than those of the main crop. In fact, the highest profit (PhP25,564.80) was obtained in ratooned plants, which received 60 kg ha-1 N basal + 30 kg ha-1 N topdress application (T3) due to higher grain yield. Thereby, this is an appropriate option that provides high productivity and income for the ratoon growers.","Aulakh, M., Khera, T.S., Doran, J.W., Singh, K. & Singh, B. (2000).

Direct and Indirect Factors Affecting Teachersâ€™ Burnout in the New Normal,"education, perceived control, teachersâ€™ personality traits, teachersâ€™ burnout, descriptive correlational, Philippines",Andrian A. Dela Cruz,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.02.06,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 has brought about tiring tasks and unending demands in the Philippine educational system. With the abrupt shift of the teaching-learning process, teachers are pressured and stressed, which leads them to be burned out. The descriptive correlational research design determines the direct and indirect effects of perceived control to burnout through teachersâ€™ personality traits of the 240 early childhood teachers. Data are analyzed using the Pearson r formula, Bivariate parametric correlation, and the Structural Equation Model (SEM). The study reveals that despite the challenges experienced in this time of pandemic, teachers have control over themselves and with the people around them. The teachersâ€™ level of control does not influence their burnout; instead, their burnout is dependent on their emotional stability. Thus, burnout is a personal choice which is triggered by oneâ€™s emotion. A person with high perceived control may still be burned out if he does not have control over his emotions.","Becker, E., GÃ¶tz, T., Morger, V., & Ranellucci, J. (2014).

Graduate Education during COVID-19 Pandemic: Inputs to Policy Formulation in the New Normal,"challenges, COVID-19, Filipino, graduate education, policy inputs",Inero Ancho,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.02.07,"This qualitative research describes the experiences of Filipino graduate students as they continue with their schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Particular challenges faced are related to technology and internet access. As graduate work is expected to be about research tasks, subscribing to paid resources is seen as an issue. It is also crucial to recognize how the experience has caused stress for students. The experienced challenges are resolved by augmenting studentsâ€™ technological capacity, realigning personal values and perspectives, and resorting to free and open access journals to sustain research activities. The COVID-19 experience has taught graduate students the importance of technology, the significance of revisiting oneâ€™s values, and the reflection on their quest to finish their graduate studies. Lastly, assistance to graduate students can be done by proactively offering infrastructure assistance, socio-emotional support, and institutionalizing responsive and flexible communication mechanisms.

Cadosales, Angelito Jr. B. Cabanilla, Naila Y. Beltran",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.02.08,"The Commission on Higher Education emphasized that extension programs provide the space to discover practical evidence, and science-based answers to real-world social, economic, and environmental challenges for partner communities. This descriptive study looked into the impact of an extension program to address the needs of the day care workers. It employed a questionnaire, unstructured interview, and focus group discussion in gathering the data. The study revealed that the parents and the social workers were responsive to the needs of the day care workers.  Seven themes emerged namely: eliciting parents and childrenâ€™s active involvement, improving collaboration and communication, learning from seminars, availing necessities and learning resources, improving pedagogical competence and practices of DCWs, and improving the learning environment. The extension program helped the day care workers established sustainable and effective day care centers through forging and sustaining strong partnerships with parents, government, and non-government organizations.","Abulon, E.
