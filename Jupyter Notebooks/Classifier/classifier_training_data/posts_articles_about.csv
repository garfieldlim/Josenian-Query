"title: Timeless Existence and Principle of Creation: Notions Embedded in John 1:1, ""In the Beginning Was the Word"", keywords: John 1:1, Word, beginning, timeless existence, principle of creation, intentionality, author: Emiliano C. De Catalina, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.01, abstract: St. John's Gospel begins with a prologue, serving as an overture to the whole Gospel. This paper investigates the philosophical notions embedded in the first three lines of John 1:1. The inquiry focuses on whether or not the accepted meaning of this line as ""indicating timeless existence"" can be deduced from John 1:1 and whether or not John 1:1 also indicates the meaning of the ""principle of creation."" This paper proceeds to make this inquiry in the following order: Introduction; The questions arising in John 1:1; Word as God is eternal, outside time; ""In the beginning"" as predicate; ""The Word was in the beginning""; Timeless existence and the verb was; The Word as God is a principle of creation (which included the distinction between the concepts of anthropological intentionality and metaphysical intentionality); and Conclusion. This paper concludes by affirming the two questions on timeless existence and the principle of creation., published date: 2022-05-25, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/986, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1",rmrj_articles
"title: Ratooning Response of Lowland Rice (Oryza sativa L.) var. PSB Rc22 to Production Management Practices, keywords: approach, gross margin, lowland rice, management, ratooning, author: Dionesio M. BaÅˆoc, Victor B. Asio, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.08, abstract: This study aimed to determine the ratooning ability of lowland rice to production management practices. It assessed the profitability of rice ratooning to the abovementioned objectives. The experiment was set out in a split-plot organized in a Randomized Complete Block Design with production management practices as the main plot and cutting heights of ratoon crop as the subplot treatment. Production management practices notably affected all agronomic characteristics, yield, and yield component parameters evaluated except the grain yield. Cutting height remarkably influenced all growth and yield parameters tested except panicle weight. Economic analysis revealed that the improved method achieved a higher gross margin (PHP21,321.60) than the farmerâ€™s practice (PHP15,419.40) because of the formerâ€™s high productivity (1.64 t ha-1). A cutting height of 45.0 cm under the improved method obtained the highest gross margin (PHP28,677.00). Moreso, this approach is considered a good measure in adapting to the problematic scenario relative to climate change., published date: 2022-06-14, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1147, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1",rmrj_articles

Jardenil, Dennis V. Madrigal, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.02, abstract: This phenomenological research was conducted to inquire into the experiences of fathers of children with autism during the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study was explored because there is a dearth of studies focusing on paternal involvement and a lack of local autism research. Nine participants, who were chosen using purposive sampling, individually participated in an unstructured interview. The van Kaam method popularized by Moustakas was used to analyze the data gathered. Five major themes emerged: recognizing the child's needs, surviving hardships, enduring exhaustion, encountering silver linings, and moving forward. The findings showed that fathers of children with autism encountered challenging and fulfilling events during the pandemic with resilience. Fathers of children with autism prioritized familial needs, especially of the child, and increased their presence in the household. A strong paternal character builds up fathersâ€™ resilience in coping with the difficulties of raising a child with autism in a precarious time., published date: 2022-05-26, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1181, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1",rmrj_articles

Benitez, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.03, abstract: This paper inquires into the problems concerning Filipino values and moral norms. Based on the interviews with the social science and philosophy scholars and the youth leaders in the Philippines, the study identifies the following problems: Filipino identity, distortion and dysfunctionalization, manifold ambivalence, dissonance, false justification and misuse, cynicism, and decline of moral courage. Analyzed based on Hans Kelsenâ€™s concept of validity and efficacy, the problems prove to be radical given that the purported Filipino values system is actually a chaotic constellation of competing and conflicting pre-colonial, colonial, and postcolonial normative paradigms. Distorted, ambivalent, and dysfunctionalized, Filipino values and norms fail to provide effective normative guidelines. The proposed antidote of moral and values education is bound to be futile in the face of a severely mutilated social conscience., published date: 2022-05-27, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1211, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1",rmrj_articles

Also, it determines the relationship between the said constructs, and at the same, their association between the variables of sex, family structure, birth order, religious affiliation, and church involvement. The data are gathered using Ryffâ€™s Psychological Well-being and Ellison and Paloutzianâ€™s Spiritual Well-being Scale. The findings reveal moderate levels of psychological and spiritual well-being among the respondents. Point biserial shows that a significant relationship existed between the demographics of family structure and psychological well-being and between church involvement and psychological well-being. Rank biserial shows, on the other hand, that there is a significant relationship between family structure and spiritual well-being and between church involvement and spiritual well-being. Also, Spearman Rank Correlation results indicated that there is a relationship between psychological well-being and spiritual well-being., published date: 2022-05-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1188, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1",rmrj_articles

Then D is a (v, k, λ) - difference set if every nonzero element of the group can be expressed as a difference d1 - d2 of elements of D in exactly λ ways. Let q be a prime of the form q = nN + 1 for integers n>1 and N>1. For q<1000, this study shows the construction of difference sets in the additive group of the field GF(q) from unions of cyclotomic classes of order N = 14 using a computer search. The construction consisted of computer programs derived from the definitions and theorems on difference sets using Python. The results revealed that only the union of seven cyclotomic classes such as C0(14, q) U C2(14, q) U C4(14, q) U C6(14, q) U C8(14, q) U C10(14, q) U C12(14, q) forms a quadratic cyclotomic difference set.

Yu, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.06, abstract: Governance has become an increasingly important factor in the investment decisions of firms and investors. Thus, it is important to determine the quality and composition of corporate boards, which are vital overseers who act in the best interests of shareholders to improve and strengthen them. While interlocking directorates are not a recent occurrence in the Philippines, updated literature on the structure of the countryâ€™s board interlock network is sparse. Thus, this study provides a baseline snapshot by analyzing all 251 publicly-listed companies on the Philippine Stock Exchange at the director and board levels. More so, the study utilizes social network analysis tools to describe the properties of interlocking directorates and visually maps out the social network that underpins these relationships. It reveals that the board network is extensive, with almost 90% of firms connected, thanks to a handful of key directors who have high degrees of connectivity., published date: 2022-06-08, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1212, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1",rmrj_articles

Crisol, Efren Jone J. Oledan, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.07, abstract: For generations, folk medicines have been used to cure various diseases with supernatural and naturalistic causations. With ethnographic descriptive design, mananambals, Tambal Binisaya vendors, and loyal patrons served as key informants in this qualitative study. In obtaining the data, observations, field notes, and interviews were the main instruments used to investigate inculturation, which is the underlying phenomenon behind the folk Catholicism evident in Tambal Binisaya. As such, it was revealed that there are strong pieces of evidence of pre-Christian practices in Tambal Binisaya, such as belief in abyans, balance in natural elements in the body, and even animism, which are somehow divergent from Catholic beliefs that put a premium on God and the total healing of the mind, body, and spirit. Despite these differences, Tambal Binisaya somehow integrated these aspects of the two systems into a hybrid healing practice. The indigenous have indeed been married to Catholicism in Tambal Binisaya., published date: 2022-06-08, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1220, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1",rmrj_articles

This study determines the factors that significantly influence employee retention amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The study employs complete enumeration and uses primary data. After which, the results are analyzed using descriptive statistics and econometric modeling. Results reveal that employees are satisfied to do their respective jobs (M=4.09, SD=0.48). In addition, they show that the determinants such as other income (p-value=0.024), length of service (p-value=0.099), as well as reward and recognition (p-value=0.015), are significant influences to employeesâ€™ retention. Hence, these conclude that better remuneration (and the increase thereof) are more likely to retain existing employees and attract employees from other organizations. Furthermore, the study specifically recommends that employee retention be improved by further refining reward and recognition that surely meet the needs and well-being of the employees., published date: 2022-06-27, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1070, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1",rmrj_articles

In relation to this, the paper establishes a theory on the development of SIP culture in basic education utilizing theory generation through axiomatic deductive approach based on steps prescribed by R. Padua (personal communication, November 17, 2014) which creates the theory that basic education institutions contribute to high productivity in SIPs. Simply because humans and non-human resources along with quality Science instruction are needed to yield such productivity. These attributes, resources, and Science instruction foster SIP culture. These are crucial aspects as schools capacitate students and teachers, produce the SIPs, and eventually disseminate these projects in science fairs., published date: 2022-06-27, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1086, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1",rmrj_articles

Picardal, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.11, abstract: Garden-based education (GBE) is an innovative approach to enhancing learnersâ€™ academic performance. However, the mechanism of how it develops the cognitive domain of learning is unclear. This meta-synthesis of 22 published articles focusing on garden-based education integration in the educative process examined its impact on mental aspects of learning. Secondary data from each reviewed article were extracted and analyzed thematically. Five themes emerged describing the impact of GBE on the cognitive domain of learning, namely, 1) experiential learning, 2) meaningful learning, 3) explicit and implicit learning, 4) discovery learning, and 5) transmissible learning. GBE is a successful program in most of the basic education curriculum integration contributing to the improvement of academic performance. Albeit, there is no standard template for its implementation as it varies across context and educational system, adopting the general principle of school garden learning in the teaching and learning process is beneficial for sustainable learning outcomes., published date: 2022-06-28, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1215, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1",rmrj_articles

De Catalina, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.12, abstract: After the 1898 Philippine revolution, the English language was introduced in the country by the Americans and it began to surmount in the consciousness of the Filipino people. For one century now, this language has become dominant in the Filipino consciousness. Linguistically, it has even influenced the classification of the vocabulary of the Visayan-Cebuano language, i.e., according to the English eight parts of speech. But, as early as 1947, Manuel Yap, bishop and biblical scholar from Carcar, Cebu, objected, saying that the Visayan-Cebuano vocabulary does not fit in the English eight-parts-of-speech classification. This study, then, aims at inquiring into Yapâ€™s own classification of the Visayan-Cebuano vocabulary. In doing this, it uses the descriptive-analysis research design. First, it presents the English eight-parts-of-speech classification, and second, Yapâ€™s classification of the Visayan-Cebuano vocabulary.

It described first-hand real-life experiences of the suicide-loss survivors to determine the contexts, reasons, and implications of suicide and recommend community-based intervention strategies. Purposive-criterion and convenient sampling methods were used to determine the respondents. Focused group discussion and in-depth interviews were conducted to gather data analyzed using Braun & Clarkeâ€™s six-phase guide. The findings revealed that the life experiences of the respondents are characterized by regret, pain, and bereavement. Suicides were committed due to dysfunctional families, economic hardships, breakdown of relationships, and drug abuse. The pain of suicide affected both the victim and their survivors and occurs within the psychosocial sphere. Interventions should therefore employ a familial, communitarian, and inter-institutional approach. Local Government Units (LGUs) are recommended to initiate a reach-out community-based suicide intervention program and debriefing services., published date: 2022-06-28, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1206, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1",rmrj_articles

This study examined the relationship between auditors’ professional skepticism (PS) and thinking styles (TS) and explored what associations exist among PS, TS, and auditors’ sociodemographic attributes. Using snowball sampling, we surveyed 139 auditors in the Philippines using the Thinking Styles Inventory – Revised II and the Professional Skepticism Scale. Confirmatory analysis using Kendall’s tau-B showed a strong correlation between PS and TS I (creativity-generating style), implying that it plays a prominent role in professional skepticism. Contrary to earlier studies, our study found only a moderate correlation between TS II (norm-favoring style) and PS. The k-Modes clustering algorithm revealed that auditors showing high PS were low-ranking, less-experienced licensed female CPAs in firms with global affiliations and manifesting creative-generating TS. These findings add to the accounting profession’s understanding of PS and may be of valuable help in cultivating PS among auditors., published date: 2022-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1320, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 2",rmrj_articles

As such, the primary intent of Catholic education is to proclaim the message of salvation to all people. Accordingly, Catholic education aims to provide an integral formation with a religious dimension that will equip the human person to become life, work, and mission ready and attain salvation. But given the contemporary socio-economic, cultural, political, and technological milieus characterized by a secular and consumerist view and praxis, the value of Catholic education may have been obscured or affected.Â  Thus, this paper aims to investigate and analyze the views and practices of the faculty of a Catholic University about Catholic education. The purposive sampling method was used to determine the participants in the study. Using a qualitative research design, the data were gathered from the participants using the face-to-face interview method. Aided by the phenomenological method, the findings discovered semblance in the participants' views and practices of Catholic education with that of Catholic Church. Despite the observed undesirable elements that obscure and marginalize it, Catholic education faithfully remains a Catholic. But making religion as the core of the curriculum of Catholic education is still a great challenge for Catholic schools to realize. Thus, the collaboration of all stakeholders is vital to address this perennial challenge in Catholic education., published date: 2018-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/299, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 6 No. 1",rmrj_articles

Quantitative and qualitative research methods were used to collate a survey that would sure mend the study. With comprehensive computation of the random datasets, almost every Senior High School student achieved a satisfactory rating in both the Perceptions and Abilities Categories. A Chi-Square Statistic was also used and yielded maximum values which consequently, resulted to low p-values, suggesting the negation of the studyâ€™s null hypothesis. The result is further supported using the correlation statistic which corresponds to a high correlation between the studentsâ€™ Perceptions and Abilities in their speaking competence. The outcome of the summary of all competencies show that the Linguistic Competence contributed the most to the overall language intents of the students with sociolinguistic competence giving the least, which results in Linguistic Competence being the widely used language competency and sociolinguistic as not often practiced language skill amongst the students. With this, the Senior High School students are far more competent in phonetics, pronunciation, Phonology, Morphology, Syntax and Semantics rather than on the socio-cultural languages such as vocabulary, politeness and language style., published date: 2018-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/183, journal name:",rmrj_articles

Ortega, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.02.04, abstract: This paper presents an optimal dispatch of battery storage and its economic viability with a photovoltaic system. There are four modelled scenarios based on the combination of interruptible load program and the time-of-use scheme. The scenarios were modelled using a Binary Particle Swarm Optimization and were simulated using Matlab v6. In all the scenarios, this model successfully optimizes the battery dispatch scheduling while simultaneously minimizes the DUâ€™s penalty from exceeding the maximum allowable power demand. This algorithm also optimizes the linearly forecasted demand for the next six year for all the scenarios. Then, an economic analysis for the possible investment to the combined BESS and PV system is conducted through the comparison of the payback periods of each scenario. The first scenario is implemented without ILP and a ToU scheme and has 79.86 payback years. With ILP scheme only, the second scenario has 33.37 payback years. Then the third scenario with ToU scheme only has a 30.29 payback years. Finally, the fourth scenario, with both ILP and ToU schemes, shows the fastest recovery of the investment with 21.57 payback years. Thus the combination of both ILP and ToU schemes provide the best economic benefit.

Ermac, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1806.02.02, abstract: Energy conservation is a buzzword that cuts across a broad spectrum of stakeholders. It has been widely practiced, developed, and discussed in government, political, and industrial sectors due to its massive impact on tackling issues related to climate change and global warming as well as presenting opportunities to cut energy costs. Despite the active discussion of this topic in the literature, very few papers have discussed it in the context of academic institutions which has one of the most significant impacts in terms of energy consumption. To address the issue, this paper places the topic of energy conservation in the context of academic institutions. Moreover, it adopts the Theory of Planned Behavior to investigate the success of energy conservation initiatives in academic institutions by looking at user behavior and its antecedents. Finally, this paper contributes significantly to the literature as it is one of the very few papers and arguably the first to discuss energy conservation in the context of academic institutions using the Theory of Planned Behavior. Furthermore, this paper will be beneficial for practitioners and other stakeholders in that it provides them with a framework to investigate the success of implementing energy conservation initiatives, especially, in academic institutions by looking at the antecedents of user behavior., published date: 2018-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/550, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 6 No. 2",rmrj_articles

To achieve this aim, I employ Ricoeurâ€™s hermeneutics of symbols because in his different political essays, he consistently regards political power as akin to a symbol. Thus, for him, the critical appropriation of political power requires a hermeneutical procedure. And so in my discussion, I devote one section for Ricoeurâ€™s hermeneutics of symbols, one for his thoughts on political power, and another one for the critical appropriation of political power through the hermeneutics of symbols. To put Ricoeurâ€™s political and hermeneutical thoughts in a better light, I introduce these sections with a separate section on his philosophical anthropology. In my conclusion, I affirm that transforming political structures into just institutions is very much possible through the critical appropriation of political power. It is such a potential tool in effecting these transformations because the critical appropriation of political power involves a hermeneutical procedure that follows a three-step process of reflection. And reflection, which makes way for the critical appropriation of political power, is what ensures that power rests only in the hands of those who are more likely to advance the common good, resulting into a greater possibility for the transformation of political structures into just institutions., published date: 2018-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/387, journal",rmrj_articles

The occurrence of a twin prime on an interval [0,x] is assumed to be random. In particular, we considered the waiting time between arrivals of twin primes as approximated by a geometric distribution which possesses the discrete memory-less property. For large n, the geometric distribution is well-approximated by the exponential distribution. The number of twin primes less or equal to x will then follow the Poisson distribution with the same rate parameter as the exponential distribution. The results are compared with the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture on the frequency of twin primes. We successfully demonstrated that for large n, the proposed model is superior to the H-L conjecture in predicting the frequency of twin primes., published date: 2018-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/532, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 6 No. 2",rmrj_articles

Increasing atmospheric temperature had changed the dynamics of the mosquito habitats and thereby influences distribution of these mosquito vectors. We examined the increase in the number of countries within the regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas reporting laboratory confirmed dengue cases caused by DENV-1 as a response to increasing global surface temperature difference. Data on the number of countries with confirmed reports of dengue (Messina et al. 2014) and surface temperature difference (General Circulation Model) were subjected to scatter plots and linear regression. There were 113 recorded countries across three regions (America=44, comprising the North and South; Africa=28; and Asia=41) reporting dengue incidence from 1943 to 2013, of which 98 countries (America=41; Africa=20; and Asia=37 with the inclusion of Australia) reported confirmed dengue cases caused by DENV-1. Findings suggest that the effect of temperature to the expansion of dengue varies dramatically in certain groups of country. Here, we explore three patterns (PAT) of expansion response where 1) continuous increase in temperature results into a continuous increase in the number of countries with dengue cases (PAT-A), 2) initial increase in temperature results into increase in the number of countries with dengue cases but subsequent increase in temperature results in the decline of dengue expansion (PAT-B),",rmrj_articles

The present investigation was conducted in three barangays in Northwestern Cagayan covering Culao, Sitio Nagbaranganan in Centro 2 and Balingit from March 2014 to April 2015. Â The study used a descriptive survey method to identify the diversity of melliferous resources and to develop a floral calendar in relation to pollen and nectar availability in the area. Data was analyzed using a frequency count. Â In the three vegetations sampled, 54 plant species are useful to honeybees, 27 of which are forest trees, 25 are agricultural crops, and one each is a shrub and a weed. The study ascertained 18 flowering plants as extremely important bee floras since these blossom throughout the year. March to May were identified as the honey flow periods.Â  July to September (dry season) and October to December (rainy season) were the dearth periods for honeybees in the study area. A floral calendar was developed based on the characteristics, abundance, time and duration of bloom of the bee flora.

Considering this thought, each country implements different strategies and national policies to support the development of renewable sources. However, these emerging developments may contribute to its depletion of natural sources. In this paper, an exploratory pattern analysis was used on 125 selected countries to determine the underlying trends on the effect of the development of renewable energy (RE) sources while utilizing the countriesâ€™ natural resources. Due to different status of each country, the trends were grouped in similar associations such as negative, positive and bell-like relationships. Developed countries showed a negative relationship where the natural resources are heavily utilized in the early stages but rapidly decreased as the RE progresses. This reflects the capability of these countries with high to very-high human development index (HDI) to invest more on advanced technologies which utilize fewer natural resources. On the other hand, the underdeveloped countries with low to moderate HDI behave in a positive relationship showing their heavily dependence on its natural resources as RE progresses. Moreover, a group of developing countries between developed and underdeveloped categories and without direct relationship to HDI showed a transition between positive to negative transition as the RE progresses.",rmrj_articles

The variations in the environmentâ€™s setting, however, may constitute to the occurrence of measurement errors. A study investigated the significant effect of changing the camera-to-lens displacements and the variations of the illumination level on the short-distance measurement reading. This is performed initially by developing an actual setup calibrated though the comparison with the hypothesized values. Then, an experiment on this calibrated setup generates the measurement results of varying the displacement positions and the illumination levels. Through descriptive and comparative statistical analysis, there is evidence that the variations of the displacement alone do not significantly change the measurement results. Similarly, the variations in the illumination levels do not also constitute significant changes on the measurement results. Hence, each of the variables bears no contribution on the occurrence of the measurement error of using camera. It is further confirmed through the two way analysis of variance that there is no significant difference on the displacement positions and illumination levels, and on their interactions. These results verified that a camera can be used as a short-distance measurement tool adequately regardless on the object-to-lens displacement positions and on the illumination levels., published date: 2016-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/199, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 4 No. 1",rmrj_articles

Government effectiveness (GE) and corruption control (CC) are the direct predictors and independent variables while global competitiveness (GC) is the response variable. The determined causal factors affected by government effectiveness and corruption control are human development (HD) and enabling trade facilitation (ETF) which have varied impacts to global competitiveness. The researcher utilized a path analysis where 6 path models were established from the predictors (x) to its response variable (y) to determine which among these factors creates a huge impact. Path coefficients were generated and the summation of value effects was determined. Findings revealed that government effectiveness and corruption control were substantial elements that influenced the dynamism and vitality of global competitiveness landscape. However, GE has a strong direct effect to GC as compared to CC and from amongst the indirect effects, the correlation between GE and HD relative to GC has the highest path coefficient. The existing economic and political conditions of the individual ASEAN member countries reflected by the implications of the raw data collected are seen as an impediment to a more collective performance.

It utilized multiple factors that can be useful for policy and investment decisions and are intended to complement analyses using financial poverty indicators. Using exploratory data analysis, several indicators were selected to represent the different dimensions of poverty. Said indicators were then subjected to factor analysis which yielded four multidimensional indices namely: General Welfare Index, Governance and Emotional Landscape Index, and Social Climate Index. Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia ranked 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in all three indices, respectively. In addition, multivariate cluster analysis was also performed. It revealed that Singapore exhibited exceptional performance in all indices, thereby earning it a cluster all to its own. Similarities were observed between Brunei and Malaysia while Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, and Indonesia were clustered together. Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar belonged to another cluster, indicating similarities among them. The study concluded that a wide gap exists among ASEAN countries in terms of the various deprivations measured. It also identified several problem areas and strengths of the ASEAN member states.

It practically covers the gaps between cash outflows and inflows from a countryâ€™s revenues such as those coming from taxes. However, when a countryâ€™s debt goes too high that it already has difficulty in paying it off, sovereign bankruptcy occurs. This study dwells at the factors that lead to sovereign bankruptcy among ASEAN countries in terms of business confidence, credit management, resource availability and market stability. To measure the indicators in determining the nations in the verge of being bankrupt, the researchers use the data depicting the corruption perception index, GDP and investment climate index. Furthermore, data regarding the ease of doing business rankings, credit ratings, surplus/deficit of the government budget, external debt, current account balance and inflation rate are also considered. These indicators are believed to be suggestive of a countryâ€™s capability of sustaining its overall debt, highlighting the point that an ASEAN country should take into account all its resources to ensure that it doesnâ€™t go bankrupt as a nation especially now that it is looking into integrating itself into one economic ASEAN community., published date: 2015-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/27, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 3 No. 1",rmrj_articles

This paper proposes a model that links two (2) global markets: the higher education market and the labor market, as dramatic changes are taking place in the 21st century. A modeling and simulation strategy has been employed in this paper predicting the impact of higher education market to the labor market. Results indicated that with the rapid expansion of the Higher Education(HE) market, the size of the higher education labor force will inevitably expand.The labor market tolerates a maximum expansion capacity for HE graduates beyond which the excess HE graduates will bifurcate into two (2) channels of productive sector, namely: (a) the creation of new economies or (b) the integration of HE graduates into the skilled labor force. This dynamics necessarily yields a highly fragmented labor force configuration. In essence, the evolution of the labor market is a replica of Darwinâ€™s Biological Theory of Evolution where only the fittest will survive, i.e. evolution through mutation and adaptation whose equivalent concepts in this setting are â€œinnovationâ€ and â€œadaptationâ€ respectively. It is well-established in Evolutionary Biology that â€œmutationâ€ is the shortest-route to evolution and so we posit that â€œinnovationâ€ is the shortest route to the labor market evolutionary ladder.Therefore, a good university must be able to produce graduates who are innovative and adaptive at the same time to survive in a competitive labor market., published date: 2015-06-30, link:",rmrj_articles

However, they share commonalities such as the discernment and defense of the greater good/common good over individual interests and desires; the discernment and defense of truth, rectitude, and justice over beliefs, feelings, opinions, prejudices, injustice and stereotypes; the principle of not harming others; a preventive approach to conflict management rather than curative. Therefore, philosophy is not something
abstract but offers practical strategies to manage conflict. The study is relevant because it is an additional literature on conflict management particularly from the perspective of philosophy considering that there is dearth in the literature. This study recommends that another study be made using different set of philosophers. Also, one may look into leadership or management styles reflected in the philosophy of selected philosophers., published date: 2015-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/21, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 3 No. 1",rmrj_articles

Zanoria, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.13, abstract: The remarkable growth of human knowledge is perhaps the greatest key to achieving what one wants, or what the whole economic society wants. Recognizing knowledge as one of the critical factors for economic advancement in the most multilateral organization in Asia, this study evaluates the indicators which determine the knowledge level of the ASEAN member nations. The study takes a look at factors that are predominant in the countries involved, in terms of general competency, inventions and innovations, and technological advancement. Data relating to high technology exports, human development, research and development, journals, researchers, and patents are taken
into consideration to quantify these factors in the assessment of the knowledge level of a country.

Susada, Marisa A. Mahilum, Dionisel Y. Regalado, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.14, abstract: The contrasting practices of private and public institutions affect individuals motivation to work on the maintenance of its facilities. This paper attempts to develop a model that could predict how many years a facility (private or government) would last based on the given number of assumptions and random data. The study used an experimental design using simulation modeling. Assumptions were formulated to measure different variables. Findings revealed that government facilities tend to deteriorate faster compared to its private counterparts. Government facilities would only last approximately up to six (6) years then reach its critical level. This is due to the assumption that only 40% of government institutions are effective workers. Low percentage of effective workers would translate to less motivation of the worker to pursue any transaction that could possibly help the current state of the facility. On the other hand, more than half of the Private facilities would last more than five years before reaching a critical level. This is due to the assumption that private workers are 20% higher compared to government workers in terms of percentage of effective workers. A highly motivated worker will always be willing to spend time, even extra time, to perform his job. Benign neglect of a less motivated workforce would result to non performance of his assigned task. Therefore, increasing the level of motivation of an employee is the primordial concern of every organization whether private or public because an increase of well motivated and effective workforce would encourage everyone to help maintain and to extend the life of every facility., published date: 2015-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/26,",rmrj_articles

Ethanolic extracts of Persia americana (avocado), Psidium guajava (guava), and Moringa olifera (malunggay) were tested using the paper disc diffusion method for antibacterial agent against the common poultry pathogens Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Guava and avocado extract showed almost all the secondary metabolites screened while only flavonoids and alkaloids were present in the malunggay extract. The presence of secondary metabolites applied to broiler chicks as feed additives enhances the growth performance of the chicken. There were five treatments groups identified as distilled water,Vetracin, avocado decoction, guava decoction, and malunggay decoction. Using a statistical analysis of one- way ANOVA and Duncanâ€™s Multiple Range Test (DMRT), final weight and the weight gained has significant differences including some body parts of the chicken while the final circumferential measurement doesnâ€™t have a significant difference.

committed by the students in solving math problems. In seeking for solutions, we apply the Student Self â€“Assessment (SSA) method and Newman Error Analysis (NEA) method to circumvent these errors. The SSA is a strong formative educational tool that enhances selfconfidence to become more independent in assessing their work. While, NEA serves as a powerful classroom diagnostic assessment to identify the skills of the students. It enables the teacher to devise and apply more appropriate teaching strategies and procedures that ignite the studentsâ€™ interest towards the subject. Out of the 179-students participating in the action research project, we discover that most of the error patterns are due to lack of understanding and transformation skills in solving word problems. With this result, the students encounter language difficulty and immature computational skills. To this end, the investigation and remediation of common math errors was a success in improving and achieving the learning goals and promotes positive behavioral changes towards the subject. The realization of these outcomes is through the inclusion of SSA and NEA. To

To encourage OCB in service-oriented Filipino organizations, this paper proposes a classification of OCB antecedents collected from the literature in theory and industry practice. By using the stakeholder and self-efficacy theories, the proposed four clearly defined categories point out whether these antecedents are employee-led, leader-led, organization-led, or HR-led initiatives. Since it would be burdensome for an individual to know all the factors that may influence OCB, categorizing these antecedents will help the individual to identify the behavioral aspects that he or she has control over.

Villeta, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.02.11, abstract: Health expenditure of a country is intended to finance medicines and other medical services and assistance for those people affected with diseases especially those communicable ones. The global issue of tuberculosis has been a well-known communicable disease which could result in another type of such disease, if untreated. This study is conducted to assess the treatment success of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases, which had been a burden for countries in terms of financial aspects. Through the use of multivariate cluster and principal component analyses, ASEAN countries were grouped and ranked from very highly successful to least successful in the level of treatment success which would provide comprehensive findings as to what ASEAN country successfully provides financial to their diagnosed patients. Further, it was found out that the level of success of MDR-TB treatments among ASEAN countries varies inversely with the number of patients undergoing the treatment while directly proportional to the amount of investments in health expenditures. Hence, MDR-TB treatment success depends on the level of amount of investments for health the ASEAN country has and the number of patients undergoing the treatment. Thus, the success of the treatment can be achieved at high economic price., published date: 2015-12-03, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/111, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 3 No. 2",rmrj_articles

The researcher utilized a descriptive correlational design to identify patterns of relationship that existed between the variables and to measure the strength of the relationship, which in this case involved the individual variables (educational attainment, health status, employment status, and presence of stressors), family variables (marital status, family size, family income, quality of family relationship, and family support) and social characteristics (social relationships, church attendance, access to amenities/ transportation, safe environment and community participation) and the level of subjective wellbeing among the elderly. The study was conducted in the municipality of Sagbayan, Bohol, Philippines. The researcher utilized a self-made questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale, Spiritual Wellbeing Scale and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) to gather the needed information relevant to the variables under study. Multiple regression and analysis of variance through the SPSS software were utilized in the treatment and analysis of the data. It was found out that the mean level of subjective wellbeing among elderly falls under the average level of life satisfaction which means that the elderlies are generally satisfied with the different aspects of their lives but there are certain domains that they would very much like to improve. The study also revealed that the significant predictive variables for the elderliesâ€™ subjective wellbeing include age, health status, perceived stress, community participation, family income, and neighborhood safety.

These issues may be complex but their antidote is contrarily simple. An answer is found in Immanuel Kantâ€™s thought on moral culture which pertains to three essential features, namely: obedience, truthfulness, and sociableness. This qualitative research focuses on the fundamental ideas in the section on moral culture in Kantâ€™s On Education. As my contribution to the fund of knowledge, I proceed by establishing the implications and antitheses of the three features of Kantâ€™s moral culture. A discussion on obedience differentiates its two kinds: absolute and voluntary. Absolute obedience is the result of compulsion by a command, while voluntary obedience is the result of confidence by a reasonable will. It is impossible to think of character formation without also thinking of truthfulness. Kant asserts that a man who tells lies has no character. Sociableness emphasizes on the importance of building relationships and friendships. The researcher contends that these three features of moral culture have corresponding antitheses: violation of laws of the land for obedience; lying and dishonesty (highest form is corruption in politics) for truthfulness; and human rights violation (highest form is war) for sociableness. Finally, these features are imperative in forging peace and social order which usher to a kind of development that people aspire., published date: 2015-12-03, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/112, journal name: Recoletos",rmrj_articles

Social lifestyles such as multiple sexual partnerships, commitment, protected sex practices, and health checkups are lifestyle factors that can impact on the rate at which entry into any of the epidemiologic compartments S, I or D (death) slows or accelerates. Functional relationships between these social parameters and the disease parameters determined the model developed in this study and used predictive agent-based model to simulate the level of spread of HIV cases in Cebu with base data of the risky lifestyle of BPO agents in the region that could make them vulnerable to infections. Simulation results revealed that there is a rise on the incidence of HIV infections every year, which could become an epidemic in the future if no immediate intervention will be done. Â This high incidence of HIV cases in Cebu as evidenced by simulation results reflect the lack of awareness, prompt action, and policy in Cebu City with regards to mitigating the spread of the virus.

Ycot, John Vincent L. Tiansing, Michaela B. Aliganga, Rachel Mabanag Chong, Jun-Jun Alegrado Obiso, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1705.01.01, abstract: In the Philippines, the installation of solar panels on the rooftops of residential and commercial buildings has increased in popularity. Even if the country has high solar insolation, energy conversion is still inefficient since the solar panel arrays are not always facing in perpendicular to the sun. Technologies related to increasing the solar panel efficiency such as solar trackers are usually complex and expensive. This problem is addressed by designing a low cost dual axis solar tracker with the integration of specular reflector system. The dual axis tracker system can move the panel and the reflector assembly in a precise and controlled manner to ensure maximum output. This was achieved by using a LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) compass assembly, gear system, and stepper motor mechanism. To measure the solar panel output, a voltage sensing circuit was incorporated instead of using the existing optical and time-based techniques. The system performance was tested in both the controlled and the actual environments. Experimental data have shown that when the panel is perpendicular to the light source, the system yields maximum energy. The need for a tracking and planar reflector system is notably important when the light source moves away from the normal because this results to a significant drop of the panelâ€™s average efficiency. The addition of the tracker alone had greater enhancement effect than with the specular reflector only. The tracker boosts the efficiency by 69.55% while the specular reflector boosts it by only 15.12%. Combining the tracker and the specular reflector yields the best result with a",rmrj_articles

It is also found that there is a significant difference in perception between hiring managers and prospective applicants on usergenerated content on candidate social media profile., published date: 2019-06-06, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/631, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 7 No. 1",rmrj_articles

Here, the toxicity of C. cebuense leaf extract (CCLE) was evaluated using brine shrimp lethality assay (BSLA) and anthelminthic assay under a complete randomized design with equal replications. Results in BSLA revealed an LC50 value of 7.05 Î¼g/ml (pâ‰¤0.05) which is considerably medium-toxic based on standard toxicity criterion. Influence on earthworm activity showed significant difference (pâ‰¤0.01) among the different concentrations of the extract (100 mg/ml, 75 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, and 25 mg/ml) following a concentration-dependent response trend. Results suggest strong toxicity against earthworms at 75â€“100 mg/ml while having a moderate to weak toxicity at 25â€“50mg/ml. Both assays were able to elucidate toxicity of CCLE which may be due to the presence of cinnamaldehyde, the main phytochemical found in cinnamon leaves.

Sex differences in the occurrence of depressive symptoms have likewise been extensively reported in literature. However, a great majority of related research have primarily been carried out in the Western context. Hence, we conducted a study to identify the prevalence of depressive symptoms among Malaysian adolescents, and to determine its relationship with certain risk factors as well as the potential moderating role of sex. The sample comprised 964 adolescents from 20 secondary schools across Malaysia. Using logistic regression, results demonstrated that stressful life events and maternal verbal aggression significantly predicted symptoms of depression. In the moderation tests, sex significantly interacted with stressful life events and parental verbal aggression in predicting depressive symptoms. Hence, there is evidence to suggest that the depressogenic impact of stressful life events and parental verbal aggression on depressive symptomatology differs between male and female adolescents., published date: 2019-07-09, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/680, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 7 No. 1",rmrj_articles

On one hand, Rubrico is optimistic that it could be a model variety of a more democratic and inclusive Filipino language that should be open to contributions and alterations from the other Philippine languages. On the other hand, Dolalas is giving a warning that the continued hegemony of the Tagalog/Filipino language on the Cebuano language will eventually destroy the latter. When conceptualized using the communication accommodation theory of Giles, the seemingly conflicting hypotheses would actually fit into a single construct that lines up the Cebuano language, the process of divergence, the Davao Filipino language, the process of convergence, and the Tagalog/Filipino language. Using the same communication accommodation theory, this paper assessed the validities of the two hypotheses, and attempted to formulate more acceptable hypotheses on the status and impact of the Davao Filipino language., published date: 2017-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/267, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 5 No. 2",rmrj_articles

Findings show that educated human capital converge more in highly developed areas where risks matter less and safety measures exist. This results to a concentrated high GRDP in some. It further reveals that index and non-index crime rate is not a hindrance for a person to move in the area with many opportunities as long as life is not at stake. There were more educated individuals in regions with lower GRDP; however, they practiced and worked in highly developed areas and where law is enforced, eyeing a better condition of life.

Using a descriptive research design, the data were collected using a self-administered survey questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The major findings of the study show that the respondents demonstrated a very high level of awareness and attitude and high extent of practice of solid waste management. A significant difference was found in the awareness, attitude, and practices of respondents when they were grouped according to status and religion. Also, the findings established the relationship between awareness and attitude on one hand andÂ Â  the extent of practice of solid waste management. Awareness, attitudes, and practices were significantly related to age and educational level, except for sex which showed no correlation with attitude and practices.

The foremost era that reflects this description points to postmodernism as a politics of difference. Nietzscheâ€™s perspectivism is generally a critique of the conditions that absolutize truth. While this may seem a valiant opening for a welcoming era on an epistemological standpoint, it does not however do away with its own paradoxes. I contend whether this fits well with postmodernism and its ironic relationship to truth and asserts further that the conditions for Nietzscheâ€™s perspectivism can only achieve its future if it hermeneutically stands as political consensus.

In this convergent mixed-method design, the researchers determined the SHS Chemistry teachersâ€™ (n=30) knowledge, perceptions, GC integration in Chemistry topics, and challenges in teaching Green Chemistry Education (GCE). Complementary quantitative and qualitative results showed valid and reliable findings, claiming that teachers have limited preconceived knowledge on GCE but perceived it as an essential part of the teaching-learning process. Awareness of chemical hazards and their impacts on the environment is often demonstrated but rarely elaborated during discussions in Chemistry classes. Problems encountered in teaching GCE were also identified. A moderate positive correlation between the teachersâ€™ knowledge and their GC perception was observed.

The simulation algorithm that determines the generators and the number of generators, g of (Zp)* for a prime p is illustrated using Python programming. The probability of getting a generator g of (Zp)*, denoted by (Ø(Ø(p)))/(Ø(p)), is generated for prime p between 0 to 3000. The scatterplot is also shown that depicts the data points on the probability (Ø(Ø(p)))/(Ø(p)) of the group of units (Zp)* with respect to the order p - 1 of (Zp)* for prime p between 0 to 3000.

Eight beam samples, with dimensions of 160 mm x 150 mm x 1400 mm are loaded and simulated under a four-point loading test until failure using a reaction framework machine. A camera is fixed at the center front view of the concrete beams to capture the deflection of the samples while testing. In each test, a dial indicator is installed and the maximum deflection is manually recorded. Based on the results, the maximum deflection values recorded by the proposed application obtained an average error of 18.38 % when compared to the manual measured results. This indicates that computer vision-based application can provide a beam-wide scale deflection performance, compared to the traditional point-based deflection reading.

"Peer review (also known as refereeing) is the process of subjecting an author's scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field. It requires a community of experts in a given (and often narrowly defined) field who are qualified and able to perform impartial reviews. Likewise, it also refers to the work done while screening submitted manuscripts and funding applications. This normative process encourages authors to meet the accepted standards of their discipline. It prevents disseminating unwarranted claims, unacceptable interpretations, and personal views. Peer review increases the probability that weaknesses will be identified and fixed. For both grant funding and publication in a scholarly journal, it is also usually required that the subject be both novel and substantial.

Reviewers and editors are responsible for providing a constructive and prompt evaluation of submitted research papers based on the significance of their contribution and the rigors of analysis and presentation.

There are two or three referees for a given article. Two are experts on the topic, and one is an expert in research and statistics who shall review the technical components of the research. These referees revert the evaluation of the work that indicates the observed weaknesses or problems along with suggestions for improvement. The board then evaluates the referees' comments and notes the opinion of the manuscript before passing the decision with the referees' comments back to the author(s).",usjr_about

"A manuscript is accepted when

it is endorsed for publication by at least two referees,
it substantially complies with the instructions of the reviewers;
it complies with the ethical standards and protocols with studies involving humans and animals;

In situations where the referees disagree substantially about the quality of work, there are several strategies for reaching a decision. When the editor receives positive and negative reviews for the same manuscript, the board will solicit one or more additional reviews as a tie-breaker. In the case of ties, the board may invite authors to reply to a referee's criticisms and permit a compelling rebuttal to break the tie. Suppose the editor does not feel confident in weighing the persuasiveness of a rebuttal. In that case, the board may solicit a response from the referee who made the original criticism. In rare instances, the board will convey communications between an author and a referee, thereby allowing them to debate on a point. Even in such a case, however, the board does not allow referees to confer with each other, and the goal of the process is explicitly not to reach a consensus or to convince anyone to change his/ her opinions.",usjr_about

"USJ-R SED Treats Japanese Visitors to Unforgettable Campus Visit  In an experience they will remember and cherish for the rest of their lives, students and teachers from Nishi Yamato High School were both literally and figuratively treated to a one-of-a-kind edu-cultural immersion last June 10, 2023, at the University of Jose-Recoletos Basak Campus Auditorium.  The program started with the opening remarks from Rev. Fr. Persiuz Decena, OAR, warmly welcoming the visitors from Nara Prefecture to the campus. Dr. Jestoni Babia, the former Dean of the USJ-R School of Education and Director of the Center of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) gave a very robust speech on the importance of cross-cultural activities especially in light of common ground pertaining to sustainable initiatives and socio-environmental consciousness.  Emphasizing the strategic significance of the USJ-R School of Education as a hub for both academic excellence and sustainable education, Prof. Ma. Aira Chenessa B. Aguilar, Chair of the Department of Teacher Education, laid out key milestones and achievements of the college that ranged from multiple won competitions on innovative pandemic-era teaching practices to various Scopus-indexed publications with particular focus on best scientific and research-based sustainability efforts. It is worth noting that the School of Education has been designated a Center of Excellence in Teacher Education since 1996.  Prof. Justine Marie Munez, Adviser of the Josenian Educators (JOED) organization, gave a detailed presentation of JOEDâs ongoing efforts to continue aligning its priorities with those of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), particularly in the UNâs Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). She enumerated several completed and future projects JOED has undertaken and will take part in to demonstrate the organizationâs laserlike focus on training Josenian educators not only to become quality teachers in the classroom but individuals who can be counted upon as responsible global citizens in a constantly changing society.  After a series of presentations on the intricacies of the Philippine educational system and Filipino culture, the Japanese visitors were on the receiving end of the âlearning by doingâ instructional approach as the JOED officers and selected SED students, in various stations, showcased the unique and original Filipino cuisine, dances, and games, and invited the Japanese students to take part in each category. The primary point of this segment of the program was to introduce the visitors to the rich cultural legacy of the Filipinos and to steer them toward appreciating these unique cultural attributes while recognizing the value of USJ-R SED as an institution firmly committed to cross-cultural efforts to enhance the sharing of best practices and prioritizing the pursuit of common goals toward a sustainable future.  The success of the cultural immersion by our Japanese friends was yet another feather in the cap for the USJ-R School of Education and Josenian Educators organization in our continued drive toward the enhancement of the multi-pronged areas of quality instruction, strategic internationalization, and global citizenship. With this effort, expect more meaningful collaboration and productive partnerships to ensue between the School of Education and various entities from the governmental, civic, and academic communities from here and abroad to be forged and fostered. The continued exchange and sharing of innovative and forward-looking ideas and initiatives will only serve to help us in the School of Education deliver the kind of education and learning to mold our students in ultimately becoming not just excellent teachers in the classroom, but competent and reliable stewards of the world.  #SEDExcellence #TakingYouForwardSince1947 #JosenianEducators",facebook_posts

"SED Recognizes Outstanding Josenian Educators in Caritas Ceremony  In grateful recognition for the individuals who positively impacted the college throughout the academic year, the School of Education of the University of San Jose-Recoletos held the eighth âCaritas et Scientia Leadership Awardsâ last May 10, 2023, at the USJ-R Basak Coliseum.  Starting things off, Dr. Jestoni P. Babia, Dean of the School of Education, provided the opening remarks and noted the various achievements, as well as the significant challenges that lay ahead, within the college. He underscored that while SED has come this far regarding its innumerable accomplishments and milestones, important opportunities must be addressed and managed. He looked forward to future leadership having the creativity, initiative, and resourcefulness to fill the gaps and further enhance the enormously magnificent reputation SED has already carved out for itself. As a very important note, SED has maintained its gold-standard status as a Center of Excellence for Teacher Education, exemplifying its prestige as a go-to place for aspiring teachers who want nothing less than quality pedagogical instruction and training.  Multiple and various awards were given to both the students and faculty members. The awards night capped a yearlong grind by teachers and students who slugged it out against the numerous PowerPoint presentations, learning modules, reviews, reports, grades, and so much other paperwork they had to accomplish against a myriad of deadlines. In the end, the sleepless nights and seemingly bottomless iced coffee cups were all worth it â all for the sake of ensuring that both sides obtain the education and learning that would not only serve them well in the four corners of the classroom â but in the contextualized reality of a continually unpredictable world. After all, Josenian Educators do not just teach; they inspire.
