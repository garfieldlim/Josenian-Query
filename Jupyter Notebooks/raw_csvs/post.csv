6.42805E+14,"USJ-R SED Treats Japanese Visitors to Unforgettable Campus Visit

In an experience they will remember and cherish for the rest of their lives, students and teachers from Nishi Yamato High School were both literally and figuratively treated to a one-of-a-kind edu-cultural immersion last June 10, 2023, at the University of Jose-Recoletos Basak Campus Auditorium.

The program started with the opening remarks from Rev. Fr. Persiuz Decena, OAR, warmly welcoming the visitors from Nara Prefecture to the campus. Dr. Jestoni Babia, the former Dean of the USJ-R School of Education and Director of the Center of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) gave a very robust speech on the importance of cross-cultural activities especially in light of common ground pertaining to sustainable initiatives and socio-environmental consciousness.

Emphasizing the strategic significance of the USJ-R School of Education as a hub for both academic excellence and sustainable education, Prof. Ma. Aira Chenessa B. Aguilar, Chair of the Department of Teacher Education, laid out key milestones and achievements of the college that ranged from multiple won competitions on innovative pandemic-era teaching practices to various Scopus-indexed publications with particular focus on best scientific and research-based sustainability efforts. It is worth noting that the School of Education has been designated a Center of Excellence in Teacher Education since 1996.

Prof. Justine Marie Munez, Adviser of the Josenian Educators (JOED) organization, gave a detailed presentation of JOEDâ€™s ongoing efforts to continue aligning its priorities with those of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), particularly in the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). She enumerated several completed and future projects JOED has undertaken and will take part in to demonstrate the organizationâ€™s laserlike focus on training Josenian educators not only to become quality teachers in the classroom but individuals who can be counted upon as responsible global citizens in a constantly changing society.

After a series of presentations on the intricacies of the Philippine educational system and Filipino culture, the Japanese visitors were on the receiving end of the â€œlearning by doingâ€ instructional approach as the JOED officers and selected SED students, in various stations, showcased the unique and original Filipino cuisine, dances, and games, and invited the Japanese students to take part in each category. The primary point of this segment of the program was to introduce the visitors to the rich cultural legacy of the Filipinos and to steer them toward appreciating these unique cultural attributes while recognizing the value of USJ-R SED as an institution firmly committed to cross-cultural efforts to enhance the sharing of best practices and prioritizing the pursuit of common goals toward a sustainable future.

The success of the cultural immersion by our Japanese friends was yet another feather in the cap for the USJ-R School of Education and Josenian Educators organization in our continued drive toward the enhancement of the multi-pronged areas of quality instruction, strategic internationalization, and global citizenship. With this effort, expect more meaningful collaboration and productive partnerships to ensue between the School of Education and various entities from the governmental, civic, and academic communities from here and abroad to be forged and fostered. The continued exchange and sharing of innovative and forward-looking ideas and initiatives will only serve to help us in the School of Education deliver the kind of education and learning to mold our students in ultimately becoming not just excellent teachers in the classroom, but competent and reliable stewards of the world.

She was elected as chair of the Standing Committee of the Council of Diplomatic Representatives of HCCH on May 23, making her the first woman to assume the post. The HCCH is an intergovernmental organization that administers international conventions related to private international law.

PH EMBASSYâ€™S OFFICIAL MAKES HISTORY AS FIRST WOMAN ELECTED AS CHAIR OF HCCH STANDING COMMITTEE

Atty. Marisar Ivy Cabatingan, Third Secretary and Vice Consul of the Philippine Embassy in The Hague, was elected Chair of the Standing Committee of the Council of Diplomatic Representatives (CDR) of the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH) during the 69th meeting of the CDR on May 23 at the Peace Palace in The Hague.

â€œWe thank the members of the Council for the trust and confidence they have reposed on Ms. Cabatingan. The Philippines is pleased to further contribute to the work of the HCCH through her,â€ Ambassador J. Eduardo Malaya said. â€œThis development demonstrates the country's proactive engagement with international legal organizations and commitment to the vital role of the HCCH.â€

Atty. Cabatingan is the first woman to assume the Chairmanship of the CDR Standing Committee. She previously served as CDRâ€™s Vice Chairperson since May 2022.

She is an alumna of the University of San Jose Recoletos College of Law in Cebu.

Embassy of Polandâ€™s First Secretary Paulina Dudzik was also elected as Vice Chair of the Standing Committee of the CDR, which demonstrated the commendable efforts of the HCCH in ensuring geographical representation and gender balance within the leadership roles of the organization.

The HCCH is an intergovernmental organization that administers international conventions related to private international law. The Philippines has acceded to several conventions under the HCCH, including the Inter-Country Adoption Convention, the Convention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abduction, the Apostille Convention, the Service Convention, and the Child Support Convention. With a membership of 91, consisting of 90 States and one regional economic integration organization (the European Union), the HCCH facilitates cooperation among nations in the aspects of private international law.

The HCCH-CDR comprises Ambassadors of the HCCH Member States or their designated representatives and serves as the supreme authority in matters of finance and budget within the HCCH. It exercises oversight on financial administration and is chaired by the Netherlands Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Standing Committee, on the other hand, which is led by a member elected from the CDR, supports its work and deliberates on financial and budgetary concerns raised by any Member State or the HCCH Secretary General. // END",2023-05-30T10:41:41,https://scontent.fceb2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/350136586_267017355804533_813165530718015830_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_fr_q65&_nc_cat=101&cb=99be929b-59f725be&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=110474&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_eui2=AeHLxgQ6CcTnRYN2wRxHX7h2Gu_xElJ65Dwa7_ESUnrkPEKsDEBFuQz7vGNVIwGXclPqMaFCIznsHxkqF19D1lHe&_nc_ohc=bzoVSlZoPIgAX_uXecW&_nc_ht=scontent.fceb2-1.fna&oh=00_AfBUAFNL4HE_XKWRyHTmKKVE_m0V1gU1zFZD9yv5lx9tKg&oe=64B8E8DE&manual_redirect=1,https://scontent.fceb2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/350136586_267017355804533_813165530718015830_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_q65_s320x320&_nc_cat=101&cb=99be929b-59f725be&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=110474&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_eui2=AeHLxgQ6CcTnRYN2wRxHX7h2Gu_xElJ65Dwa7_ESUnrkPEKsDEBFuQz7vGNVIwGXclPqMaFCIznsHxkqF19D1lHe&_nc_ohc=bzoVSlZoPIgAX_uXecW&_nc_ht=scontent.fceb2-1.fna&oh=00_AfCk6MCDPX6K-76AXZWSaickKgiaPUm3KMBZIuFP-nFXAA&oe=64B8E8DE,,https://facebook.com/usjr.official/posts/634108432094232,,

6.2755E+14,"SED Recognizes Outstanding Josenian Educators in Caritas Ceremony

In grateful recognition for the individuals who positively impacted the college throughout the academic year, the School of Education of the University of San Jose-Recoletos held the eighth â€œCaritas et Scientia Leadership Awardsâ€ last May 10, 2023, at the USJ-R Basak Coliseum.

Starting things off, Dr. Jestoni P. Babia, Dean of the School of Education, provided the opening remarks and noted the various achievements, as well as the significant challenges that lay ahead, within the college. He underscored that while SED has come this far regarding its innumerable accomplishments and milestones, important opportunities must be addressed and managed. He looked forward to future leadership having the creativity, initiative, and resourcefulness to fill the gaps and further enhance the enormously magnificent reputation SED has already carved out for itself. As a very important note, SED has maintained its gold-standard status as a Center of Excellence for Teacher Education, exemplifying its prestige as a go-to place for aspiring teachers who want nothing less than quality pedagogical instruction and training.

Multiple and various awards were given to both the students and faculty members. The awards night capped a yearlong grind by teachers and students who slugged it out against the numerous PowerPoint presentations, learning modules, reviews, reports, grades, and so much other paperwork they had to accomplish against a myriad of deadlines. In the end, the sleepless nights and seemingly bottomless iced coffee cups were all worth it â€“ all for the sake of ensuring that both sides obtain the education and learning that would not only serve them well in the four corners of the classroom â€“ but in the contextualized reality of a continually unpredictable world. After all, Josenian Educators do not just teach; they inspire.
