The 125th Anniversary of Philippine Independence and Nationhood is a multi-year commemoration of the 125th anniversary of the proclamation of Philippine independence and the allied historical events that brought about the founding of the Filipino nation from 1898 to 1901.  With the theme Kalayaan, Kinabukasan, Kasaysayan, it aims to serve as a milestone for the Filipino people to reflect on our journey as a free and independent people and how far we have gone from the dreams and aspirations of our forebears. It also highlights the role of our history in our journey as a people, to serve as a reminder of where we began from and of our goals as a country.  #PH125 #KalayaanKinabukasanKasaysayan  Cultural and Historical Affairs Office - Cebu City June 12 at 12:17 PM Â·  ð\\x9d\\x97\\x96ð\\x9d\\x97²ð\\x9d\\x97¯ð\\x9d\\x98\\x82ð\\x9d\\x97®ð\\x9d\\x97»ð\\x9d\\x97¼ ð\\x9d\\x97§ð\\x9d\\x97¿ð\\x9d\\x97®ð\\x9d\\x97»ð\\x9d\\x98\\x80ð\\x9d\\x97¹ð\\x9d\\x97®ð\\x9d\\x98\\x81ð\\x9d\\x97¶ð\\x9d\\x97¼ð\\x9d\\x97» ð\\x9d\\x97¼ð\\x9d\\x97³ ð\\x9d\\x98\\x81ð\\x9d\\x97µð\\x9d\\x97² ð\\x9d\\x97¢ð\\x9d\\x97³ð\\x9d\\x97³ð\\x9d\\x97¶ð\\x9d\\x97°ð\\x9d\\x97¶ð\\x9d\\x97®ð\\x9d\\x97¹ ð\\x9d\\x97§ð\\x9d\\x97µð\\x9d\\x97²ð\\x9d\\x97ºð\\x9d\\x97² ð\\x9d\\x97¦ð\\x9d\\x97¼ð\\x9d\\x97»ð\\x9d\\x97´ ð\\x9d\\x97¼ð\\x9d\\x97³ ð\\x9d\\x98\\x81ð\\x9d\\x97µð\\x9d\\x97² ð\\x9d\\x9f\\xadð\\x9d\\x9f®ð\\x9d\\x9f±ð\\x9d\\x98\\x81ð\\x9d\\x97µ ð\\x9d\\x97\\x94ð\\x9d\\x97»ð\\x9d\\x97»ð\\x9d\\x97¶ð\\x9d\\x98\\x83ð\\x9d\\x97²ð\\x9d\\x97¿ð\\x9d\\x98\\x80ð\\x9d\\x97®ð\\x9d\\x97¿ð\\x9d\\x98\\x86 ð\\x9d\\x97¼ð\\x9d\\x97³ ð\\x9d\\x97£ð\\x9d\\x97µð\\x9d\\x97¶ð\\x9d\\x97¹ð\\x9d\\x97¶ð\\x9d\\x97½ð\\x9d\\x97½ð\\x9d\\x97¶ð\\x9d\\x97»ð\\x9d\\x97² ð\\x9d\\x97\\x9cð\\x9d\\x97»ð\\x9d\\x97±ð\\x9d\\x97²ð\\x9d\\x97½ð\\x9d\\x97²ð\\x9d\\x97»ð\\x9d\\x97±ð\\x9d\\x97²ð\\x9d\\x97»ð\\x9d\\x97°ð\\x9d\\x97² ð\\x9d\\x97®ð\\x9d\\x97»ð\\x9d\\x97± ð\\x9d\\x97¡ð\\x9d\\x97®ð\\x9d\\x98\\x81ð\\x9d\\x97¶ð\\x9d\\x97¼ð\\x9d\\x97»ð\\x9d\\x97µð\\x9d\\x97¼ð\\x9d\\x97¼ð\\x9d\\x97±  Watch the Cebuano translation music video of Samot-Saring iisa, the Official Theme Song of the 125th Anniversary of Philippine Independence and Nationhood.
