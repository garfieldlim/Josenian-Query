It will provide recruiters an initial assessment of the candidates as well as supplementary information to support traditional recruitment and talent acquisition activities thereby reducing time and cost spent for character investigation. The application uses social media analytics to assign a social profile score. Unstructured text data are preprocessed to include only keywords which are relevant to the analysis. Word sense disambiguation is applied to determine the underlying meaning of the words. The bag-of-word is then checked for occurrence of associated words defined for each factor. Posts containing at least one occurrence of words associated with the factors are further tested for content polarity. Social character score is computed using proposed formula. The system recommends applicants based on skills and uses social character score for relevancy ranking of candidates relative to the job posts., published date: 2017-10-11, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/245, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 5 No. 1'} \n",

Based on the interviews with the social science and philosophy scholars and the youth leaders in the Philippines, the study identifies the following problems: Filipino identity, distortion and dysfunctionalization, manifold ambivalence, dissonance, false justification and misuse, cynicism, and decline of moral courage. Analyzed based on Hans Kelsenâ€™s concept of validity and efficacy, the problems prove to be radical given that the purported Filipino values system is actually a chaotic constellation of competing and conflicting pre-colonial, colonial, and postcolonial normative paradigms. Distorted, ambivalent, and dysfunctionalized, Filipino values and norms fail to provide effective normative guidelines.

Through unstructured interviews, 13 Filipino women participated in the study regarding their involvement in school affairs regarding their child’s attendance at Korean schools. The challenges faced by the participants were also explored. Findings show Filipino mothers’ eagerness to attend to the academic needs of their children through various programs and activities. Responsibilities and challenges faced by Filipino women span teaching their children and academic monitoring at home, despite not being fluent in Korean.

Regression models examined the significant predictors and organizational outcomes of work engagement. Perceived Organizational Support and Servant Leadership significantly predicted Work Engagement in Singapore and Thailand. Work Engagement had a positive impact on Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) directed toward organizations in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. It had a significant effect on OCB directed toward teachers in Malaysia and Thailand. Work Engagement also predicted Affective commitment in India and Singapore.

With ethnographic descriptive design, mananambals, Tambal Binisaya vendors, and loyal patrons served as key informants in this qualitative study. In obtaining the data, observations, field notes, and interviews were the main instruments used to investigate inculturation, which is the underlying phenomenon behind the folk Catholicism evident in Tambal Binisaya. As such, it was revealed that there are strong pieces of evidence of pre-Christian practices in Tambal Binisaya, such as belief in abyans, balance in natural elements in the body, and even animism, which are somehow divergent from Catholic beliefs that put a premium on God and the total healing of the mind, body, and spirit. Despite these differences, Tambal Binisaya somehow integrated these aspects of the two systems into a hybrid healing practice.
