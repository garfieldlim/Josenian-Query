This paper investigates the philosophical notions embedded in the first three lines of John 1:1.

Ratooning Response of Lowland Rice (Oryza sativa L.) var. PSB Rc22 to Production Management Practices,"approach, gross margin, lowland rice, management, ratooning","Dionesio M. BaÅˆoc, Victor B. Asio",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.08,"This study aimed to determine the ratooning ability of lowland rice to production management practices. It assessed the profitability of rice ratooning to the abovementioned objectives. The experiment was set out in a split-plot organized in a Randomized Complete Block Design with production management practices as the main plot and cutting heights of ratoon crop as the subplot treatment. Production management practices notably affected all agronomic characteristics, yield, and yield component parameters evaluated except the grain yield. Cutting height remarkably influenced all growth and yield parameters tested except panicle weight. Economic analysis revealed that the improved method achieved a higher gross margin (PHP21,321.60) than the farmerâ€™s practice (PHP15,419.40) because of the formerâ€™s high productivity (1.64 t ha-1). A cutting height of 45.0 cm under the improved method obtained the highest gross margin (PHP28,677.00). Moreso, this approach is considered a good measure in adapting to the problematic scenario relative to climate change.","Asio, V. B. (1996).

Paternal Resilience in Time of Pandemic: A Phenomenological Inquiry on the Experiences of Fathers of Children with Autism,"Special Education, fathers of children with autism, COVID-19 pandemic, phenomenology, Philippines","Sarah Therese P. Jardenil, Dennis V. Madrigal",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.02,"This phenomenological research was conducted to inquire into the experiences of fathers of children with autism during the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study was explored because there is a dearth of studies focusing on paternal involvement and a lack of local autism research. Nine participants, who were chosen using purposive sampling, individually participated in an unstructured interview. The van Kaam method popularized by Moustakas was used to analyze the data gathered. Five major themes emerged: recognizing the child's needs, surviving hardships, enduring exhaustion, encountering silver linings, and moving forward. The findings showed that fathers of children with autism encountered challenging and fulfilling events during the pandemic with resilience. Fathers of children with autism prioritized familial needs, especially of the child, and increased their presence in the household. A strong paternal character builds up fathersâ€™ resilience in coping with the difficulties of raising a child with autism in a precarious time.","Alhuzimi, T. (2021).

Jardenil, Dennis V. Madrigal, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.02, abstract: This phenomenological research was conducted to inquire into the experiences of fathers of children with autism during the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study was explored because there is a dearth of studies focusing on paternal involvement and a lack of local autism research. Nine participants, who were chosen using purposive sampling, individually participated in an unstructured interview. The van Kaam method popularized by Moustakas was used to analyze the data gathered. Five major themes emerged: recognizing the child's needs, surviving hardships, enduring exhaustion, encountering silver linings, and moving forward. The findings showed that fathers of children with autism encountered challenging and fulfilling events during the pandemic with resilience. Fathers of children with autism prioritized familial needs, especially of the child, and increased their presence in the household. A strong paternal character builds up fathersâ€™ resilience in coping with the difficulties of raising a child with autism in a precarious time., published date: 2022-05-26, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1181, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1",c4d3893e-977e-42ab-904a-80a94a67b9b1

Based on the interviews with the social science and philosophy scholars and the youth leaders in the Philippines, the study identifies the following problems: Filipino identity, distortion and dysfunctionalization, manifold ambivalence, dissonance, false justification and misuse, cynicism, and decline of moral courage. Analyzed based on Hans Kelsenâ€™s concept of validity and efficacy, the problems prove to be radical given that the purported Filipino values system is actually a chaotic constellation of competing and conflicting pre-colonial, colonial, and postcolonial normative paradigms. Distorted, ambivalent, and dysfunctionalized, Filipino values and norms fail to provide effective normative guidelines.

The data are gathered using Ryffâ€™s Psychological Well-being and Ellison and Paloutzianâ€™s Spiritual Well-being Scale. The findings reveal moderate levels of psychological and spiritual well-being among the respondents. Point biserial shows that a significant relationship existed between the demographics of family structure and psychological well-being and between church involvement and psychological well-being. Rank biserial shows, on the other hand, that there is a significant relationship between family structure and spiritual well-being and between church involvement and spiritual well-being.

Also, it determines the relationship between the said constructs, and at the same, their association between the variables of sex, family structure, birth order, religious affiliation, and church involvement. The data are gathered using Ryffâ€™s Psychological Well-being and Ellison and Paloutzianâ€™s Spiritual Well-being Scale. The findings reveal moderate levels of psychological and spiritual well-being among the respondents. Point biserial shows that a significant relationship existed between the demographics of family structure and psychological well-being and between church involvement and psychological well-being. Rank biserial shows, on the other hand, that there is a significant relationship between family structure and spiritual well-being and between church involvement and spiritual well-being. Also, Spearman Rank Correlation results indicated that there is a relationship between psychological well-being and spiritual well-being., published date: 2022-05-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1188, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1",a9e24e6e-cfd0-4bc5-a30a-8786816b040e

The Properties of Interlocking Directorates in the Philippines: An Exploratory Analysis,"Board interlock, interlocking directorate, network analysis, Philippines, centrality",Stevenson Q. Yu,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.06,"Governance has become an increasingly important factor in the investment decisions of firms and investors. Thus, it is important to determine the quality and composition of corporate boards, which are vital overseers who act in the best interests of shareholders to improve and strengthen them. While interlocking directorates are not a recent occurrence in the Philippines, updated literature on the structure of the countryâ€™s board interlock network is sparse. Thus, this study provides a baseline snapshot by analyzing all 251 publicly-listed companies on the Philippine Stock Exchange at the director and board levels. More so, the study utilizes social network analysis tools to describe the properties of interlocking directorates and visually maps out the social network that underpins these relationships. It reveals that the board network is extensive, with almost 90% of firms connected, thanks to a handful of key directors who have high degrees of connectivity.","Adams, R. B., Hermalin, B.

Yu, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.06, abstract: Governance has become an increasingly important factor in the investment decisions of firms and investors. Thus, it is important to determine the quality and composition of corporate boards, which are vital overseers who act in the best interests of shareholders to improve and strengthen them. While interlocking directorates are not a recent occurrence in the Philippines, updated literature on the structure of the countryâ€™s board interlock network is sparse. Thus, this study provides a baseline snapshot by analyzing all 251 publicly-listed companies on the Philippine Stock Exchange at the director and board levels. More so, the study utilizes social network analysis tools to describe the properties of interlocking directorates and visually maps out the social network that underpins these relationships. It reveals that the board network is extensive, with almost 90% of firms connected, thanks to a handful of key directors who have high degrees of connectivity., published date: 2022-06-08, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1212, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1",665d5cea-d64e-4443-9445-cf4b00414ce5

In obtaining the data, observations, field notes, and interviews were the main instruments used to investigate inculturation, which is the underlying phenomenon behind the folk Catholicism evident in Tambal Binisaya. As such, it was revealed that there are strong pieces of evidence of pre-Christian practices in Tambal Binisaya, such as belief in abyans, balance in natural elements in the body, and even animism, which are somehow divergent from Catholic beliefs that put a premium on God and the total healing of the mind, body, and spirit. Despite these differences, Tambal Binisaya somehow integrated these aspects of the two systems into a hybrid healing practice.

Modeling Employee Retention Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic: An Econometric Approach,"employee retention, econometric modeling, COVID-19 pandemic, Baybay City","Dennis T. Caredo, Argina M. Pomida, Angelita L. Paradero, Leomarich F. Casinillo",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.09,"Employee retention is one of the human resource management (HRM) issues. This study determines the factors that significantly influence employee retention amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The study employs complete enumeration and uses primary data. After which, the results are analyzed using descriptive statistics and econometric modeling. Results reveal that employees are satisfied to do their respective jobs (M=4.09, SD=0.48). In addition, they show that the determinants such as other income (p-value=0.024), length of service (p-value=0.099), as well as reward and recognition (p-value=0.015), are significant influences to employeesâ€™ retention. Hence, these conclude that better remuneration (and the increase thereof) are more likely to retain existing employees and attract employees from other organizations. Furthermore, the study specifically recommends that employee retention be improved by further refining reward and recognition that surely meet the needs and well-being of the employees.","Agustiningsih, H.

Casinillo, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.09, abstract: Employee retention is one of the human resource management (HRM) issues. This study determines the factors that significantly influence employee retention amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The study employs complete enumeration and uses primary data. After which, the results are analyzed using descriptive statistics and econometric modeling. Results reveal that employees are satisfied to do their respective jobs (M=4.09, SD=0.48). In addition, they show that the determinants such as other income (p-value=0.024), length of service (p-value=0.099), as well as reward and recognition (p-value=0.015), are significant influences to employeesâ€™ retention. Hence, these conclude that better remuneration (and the increase thereof) are more likely to retain existing employees and attract employees from other organizations. Furthermore, the study specifically recommends that employee retention be improved by further refining reward and recognition that surely meet the needs and well-being of the employees., published date: 2022-06-27, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1070, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1",f611a855-bf25-43ef-86ab-a797d78905ba

Cognitive Dimension of Learning Using Garden-Based Education towards Sustainability: A Meta-Synthesis,"Garden-based education, curricular integration, Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), Meta-synthesis","Jennifer D. PaÃ±o, Jeralden R. Jumao-as, Marchee T. Picardal",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.11,"Garden-based education (GBE) is an innovative approach to enhancing learnersâ€™ academic performance. However, the mechanism of how it develops the cognitive domain of learning is unclear. This meta-synthesis of 22 published articles focusing on garden-based education integration in the educative process examined its impact on mental aspects of learning. Secondary data from each reviewed article were extracted and analyzed thematically. Five themes emerged describing the impact of GBE on the cognitive domain of learning, namely, 1) experiential learning, 2) meaningful learning, 3) explicit and implicit learning, 4) discovery learning, and 5) transmissible learning. GBE is a successful program in most of the basic education curriculum integration contributing to the improvement of academic performance. Albeit, there is no standard template for its implementation as it varies across context and educational system, adopting the general principle of school garden learning in the teaching and learning process is beneficial for sustainable learning outcomes.","Acharya, K.

Picardal, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.11, abstract: Garden-based education (GBE) is an innovative approach to enhancing learnersâ€™ academic performance. However, the mechanism of how it develops the cognitive domain of learning is unclear. This meta-synthesis of 22 published articles focusing on garden-based education integration in the educative process examined its impact on mental aspects of learning. Secondary data from each reviewed article were extracted and analyzed thematically. Five themes emerged describing the impact of GBE on the cognitive domain of learning, namely, 1) experiential learning, 2) meaningful learning, 3) explicit and implicit learning, 4) discovery learning, and 5) transmissible learning. GBE is a successful program in most of the basic education curriculum integration contributing to the improvement of academic performance. Albeit, there is no standard template for its implementation as it varies across context and educational system, adopting the general principle of school garden learning in the teaching and learning process is beneficial for sustainable learning outcomes., published date: 2022-06-28, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1215, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1",f739c250-da63-4de3-9cca-2326d50b3fda

Understanding the Suicide Phenomenon from the Perspectives of the Loss Survivors,"suicide, survivors, bereavement, psychosocial, intervention, debriefing",Randy E. Pederi,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.13,"The study is descriptive qualitative research that illustrates the circumstances and new dynamics contributing to the never-ending suicide occurrences. It described first-hand real-life experiences of the suicide-loss survivors to determine the contexts, reasons, and implications of suicide and recommend community-based intervention strategies. Purposive-criterion and convenient sampling methods were used to determine the respondents. Focused group discussion and in-depth interviews were conducted to gather data analyzed using Braun & Clarkeâ€™s six-phase guide. The findings revealed that the life experiences of the respondents are characterized by regret, pain, and bereavement. Suicides were committed due to dysfunctional families, economic hardships, breakdown of relationships, and drug abuse. The pain of suicide affected both the victim and their survivors and occurs within the psychosocial sphere. Interventions should therefore employ a familial, communitarian, and inter-institutional approach. Local Government Units (LGUs) are recommended to initiate a reach-out community-based suicide intervention program and debriefing services.","Adrian, M., McCauley, E., Berk, M. S., Asarnow, J.

Pederi, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.13, abstract: The study is descriptive qualitative research that illustrates the circumstances and new dynamics contributing to the never-ending suicide occurrences. It described first-hand real-life experiences of the suicide-loss survivors to determine the contexts, reasons, and implications of suicide and recommend community-based intervention strategies. Purposive-criterion and convenient sampling methods were used to determine the respondents. Focused group discussion and in-depth interviews were conducted to gather data analyzed using Braun & Clarkeâ€™s six-phase guide. The findings revealed that the life experiences of the respondents are characterized by regret, pain, and bereavement. Suicides were committed due to dysfunctional families, economic hardships, breakdown of relationships, and drug abuse. The pain of suicide affected both the victim and their survivors and occurs within the psychosocial sphere. Interventions should therefore employ a familial, communitarian, and inter-institutional approach. Local Government Units (LGUs) are recommended to initiate a reach-out community-based suicide intervention program and debriefing services., published date: 2022-06-28, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1206, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1",e3fdbe48-ff94-489e-82ea-a6fad5397342

Auditors’ Professional Skepticism and Its Relationship with Their Thinking Styles,"thinking styles, professional skepticism, Philippines , sociodemographic attributes, auditors","Teovy Erdel Bongcales, Ariel Balunan, Loriemar Igot, Jurienel Mae Laude, JJ Jycka Mojados, Kristine June Uy",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.02.04,"The complexity of financial reporting highlights the need for professional skepticism among auditors. This study examined the relationship between auditors’ professional skepticism (PS) and thinking styles (TS) and explored what associations exist among PS, TS, and auditors’ sociodemographic attributes. Using snowball sampling, we surveyed 139 auditors in the Philippines using the Thinking Styles Inventory – Revised II and the Professional Skepticism Scale. Confirmatory analysis using Kendall’s tau-B showed a strong correlation between PS and TS I (creativity-generating style), implying that it plays a prominent role in professional skepticism. Contrary to earlier studies, our study found only a moderate correlation between TS II (norm-favoring style) and PS. The k-Modes clustering algorithm revealed that auditors showing high PS were low-ranking, less-experienced licensed female CPAs in firms with global affiliations and manifesting creative-generating TS. These findings add to the accounting profession’s understanding of PS and may be of valuable help in cultivating PS among auditors.","Acampado, A. G., & Pajares, G. G. (2021).

This study examined the relationship between auditors’ professional skepticism (PS) and thinking styles (TS) and explored what associations exist among PS, TS, and auditors’ sociodemographic attributes. Using snowball sampling, we surveyed 139 auditors in the Philippines using the Thinking Styles Inventory – Revised II and the Professional Skepticism Scale. Confirmatory analysis using Kendall’s tau-B showed a strong correlation between PS and TS I (creativity-generating style), implying that it plays a prominent role in professional skepticism. Contrary to earlier studies, our study found only a moderate correlation between TS II (norm-favoring style) and PS. The k-Modes clustering algorithm revealed that auditors showing high PS were low-ranking, less-experienced licensed female CPAs in firms with global affiliations and manifesting creative-generating TS. These findings add to the accounting profession’s understanding of PS and may be of valuable help in cultivating PS among auditors., published date: 2022-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1320, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 2",25478b72-54dc-4728-b62a-d034c27ff4b8
The Determinants of Fake News Adaptation during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Social Psychology Approach,"adaptation, collectivism, social support, social endorsement, perceived credibility, issue involvement","Choon Ling Kwek, Ke Shin Yeow, Li Zhang, Kay Hooi Keoy, Genaro Japos",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.02.05,"Because of COVID-19, people have felt the social distance and have resorted to the internet for information needs. Hence, fake news has become prevalent as people rely on information explored online. This research aims to examine the social-cultural impacts of fake news adaptation behavior from the social psychological perspective by investigating the relationship between collectivism, social support, sense of belonging, social endorsement, fear of missing out, perceived credibility, issue involvement, and adaptation on fake news among young adults in Malaysia. A quantitative research approach with an online self-administered survey was conducted, and 451 responses were obtained through snowball sampling. In the data analysis, measurement and structural equation modeling were adopted. Findings showed that the relationships among adaptation behaviors on fake news were significantly supported. This research consummates the understanding of the influences of social-cultural (collectivism) on the judgment formation of adaptation among internet users on fake news.","Akbar, Z., Toma, I., Garcia, J.

This research aims to examine the social-cultural impacts of fake news adaptation behavior from the social psychological perspective by investigating the relationship between collectivism, social support, sense of belonging, social endorsement, fear of missing out, perceived credibility, issue involvement, and adaptation on fake news among young adults in Malaysia. A quantitative research approach with an online self-administered survey was conducted, and 451 responses were obtained through snowball sampling. In the data analysis, measurement and structural equation modeling were adopted. Findings showed that the relationships among adaptation behaviors on fake news were significantly supported. This research consummates the understanding of the influences of social-cultural (collectivism) on the judgment formation of adaptation among internet users on fake news., published date: 2022-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1322, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 2",abd02174-6c24-44a8-9ef5-a65a32c10163
Deriving a Formula in Solving Reverse Fibonacci Means,"fibonacci sequence , reverse fibonacci sequence, Binet’s formula, means","Steven Elizalde, Romeo Patan",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.02.03,"Reverse Fibonacci sequence $\{J_n\}$ is defined by the relation $J_n = 8(J_{n-1} - J_{n-2})$ for $n\geq2$ with $J_0=0$ and $J_1=1$ as initial terms.

This drink is commonly found in the province of Leyte, Philippines. Utilizing oral history coupled with related studies from reputable journals, this paper presents tuba as a beverage common and perfected in the province of Leyte, hence forms part Leyte's tangible culture. Further, this liquor, being a commodity, can be a source of income on the part of the mananggiti, the alpor, and anyone who wishes to sell it. This paper also narrates how tuba is valued as part of Leyte's culture, and tries to understand how tuba nurtures certain Filipino values.

Quantitative and qualitative research methods were used to collate a survey that would sure mend the study. With comprehensive computation of the random datasets, almost every Senior High School student achieved a satisfactory rating in both the Perceptions and Abilities Categories. A Chi-Square Statistic was also used and yielded maximum values which consequently, resulted to low p-values, suggesting the negation of the studyâ€™s null hypothesis. The result is further supported using the correlation statistic which corresponds to a high correlation between the studentsâ€™ Perceptions and Abilities in their speaking competence. The outcome of the summary of all competencies show that the Linguistic Competence contributed the most to the overall language intents of the students with sociolinguistic competence giving the least, which results in Linguistic Competence being the widely used language competency and sociolinguistic as not often practiced language skill amongst the students. With this, the Senior High School students are far more competent in phonetics, pronunciation, Phonology, Morphology, Syntax and Semantics rather than on the socio-cultural languages such as vocabulary, politeness and language style.","Anderson, A. & Lynch, T.

Balahadia, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1806.01.03, abstract: This study aims to identify whether the Senior High School students are Linguistic, Discourse, Sociolinguistic or Strategic Competent in English. Quantitative and qualitative research methods were used to collate a survey that would sure mend the study. With comprehensive computation of the random datasets, almost every Senior High School student achieved a satisfactory rating in both the Perceptions and Abilities Categories. A Chi-Square Statistic was also used and yielded maximum values which consequently, resulted to low p-values, suggesting the negation of the studyâ€™s null hypothesis. The result is further supported using the correlation statistic which corresponds to a high correlation between the studentsâ€™ Perceptions and Abilities in their speaking competence. The outcome of the summary of all competencies show that the Linguistic Competence contributed the most to the overall language intents of the students with sociolinguistic competence giving the least, which results in Linguistic Competence being the widely used language competency and sociolinguistic as not often practiced language skill amongst the students. With this, the Senior High School students are far more competent in phonetics, pronunciation, Phonology, Morphology, Syntax and Semantics rather than on the socio-cultural languages such as vocabulary, politeness and language style., published date: 2018-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/183, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 6 No. 1",f0c37cbb-fdd8-47bb-a97c-deff69eea0e7

Let C be a minimum clique dominating set in G. The clique dominating setÂ Â Â  SâŠ†V(G)\C is called an inverse clique dominating set with respect to C. The minimum cardinality of inverse clique dominating set is called an inverse clique domination number of G and is denoted by Î³cl âˆ’1 (G). An inverse clique dominating set of cardinality Î³cl âˆ’1(G) is called Î³cl âˆ’1-set of G. In this paper we investigate the concept and give some important results., published date: 2016-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/163, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 4 No. 2",4b8b95e2-1bae-4938-b7d9-1dd46fd14619
Optimal Scheduling of Battery Energy Storage for Grid-Connected Load Using Photovoltaic System (PV) via Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO),"Binary particle swarm optimization, battery energy storage system, photovoltaic system, interruptible load program, time-of-use scheme","Eduardo D.

Ortega",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.02.04,"This paper presents an optimal dispatch of battery storage and its economic viability with a photovoltaic system. There are four modelled scenarios based on the combination of interruptible load program and the time-of-use scheme. The scenarios were modelled using a Binary Particle Swarm Optimization and were simulated using Matlab v6. In all the scenarios, this model successfully optimizes the battery dispatch scheduling while simultaneously minimizes the DUâ€™s penalty from exceeding the maximum allowable power demand. This algorithm also optimizes the linearly forecasted demand for the next six year for all the scenarios. Then, an economic analysis for the possible investment to the combined BESS and PV system is conducted through the comparison of the payback periods of each scenario. The first scenario is implemented without ILP and a ToU scheme and has 79.86 payback years. With ILP scheme only, the second scenario has 33.37 payback years. Then the third scenario with ToU scheme only has a 30.29 payback years. Finally, the fourth scenario, with both ILP and ToU schemes, shows the fastest recovery of the investment with 21.57 payback years.

Drug Trafficking and the Socio-Political Economic Contexts in Selected Countries,"drug war, drug trafficking, illegal drugs, GDP, corruption index, drug laws","Englevert Pongan Reyes, Jose D. Velez Jr., Ma. Aira Chenessa C. Benitez",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.02.07,"As international criticism of the Philippine governmentâ€™s war on drugs continues, this study aims to find out the rate of drug trafficking incidences of various countries in the world and explore how this is affected by the respective countriesâ€™ legal and socio-economic conditions, specifically: (1) Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per country, (2) public sectorâ€™s perceived corruption index, and (3) countryâ€™s legal standing on prohibited drugs. This study utilizes data mining or exploratory method. Data on the various variables were gathered from statistical reports from various reputable world agencies and subjected to statistical analysis in order to determine their significance in relation to drug trafficking.Â Of the three dimensions analyzed in this study, only economic and social factors show relationship to drug trafficking. Rich countries have less corruption; thus, they have better law-enforcement. As a result, they register more drug trafficking apprehensions. Corrupt countries however, have lower apprehensions; thus, registering a lower drug trafficking rate. Poor countries register higher corruption index and lesser apprehensions of illegal drugs. To fight drug trafficking, it is important to eradicate corruption in order to gain ground in the fight against drugs.The lone dimension that shows no relationship is the political dimension such as restrictive and non-restrictive government policies on drugs. This is corroborated by other studies that indicated a War on Drugs to be ineffective as compared to drug treatment.","Fazey, C. (2007).

Benitez, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.02.07, abstract: As international criticism of the Philippine governmentâ€™s war on drugs continues, this study aims to find out the rate of drug trafficking incidences of various countries in the world and explore how this is affected by the respective countriesâ€™ legal and socio-economic conditions, specifically: (1) Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per country, (2) public sectorâ€™s perceived corruption index, and (3) countryâ€™s legal standing on prohibited drugs. This study utilizes data mining or exploratory method. Data on the various variables were gathered from statistical reports from various reputable world agencies and subjected to statistical analysis in order to determine their significance in relation to drug trafficking.Â Of the three dimensions analyzed in this study, only economic and social factors show relationship to drug trafficking. Rich countries have less corruption; thus, they have better law-enforcement. As a result, they register more drug trafficking apprehensions. Corrupt countries however, have lower apprehensions; thus, registering a lower drug trafficking rate. Poor countries register higher corruption index and lesser apprehensions of illegal drugs. To fight drug trafficking, it is important to eradicate corruption in order to gain ground in the fight against drugs.The lone dimension that shows no relationship is the political dimension such as restrictive and non-restrictive government policies on drugs. This is corroborated by other studies that indicated a War on Drugs to be ineffective as compared to drug treatment., published date: 2016-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/201, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 4 No. 2",632319be-a4d7-4412-9adc-ae50331d5b67

Perdio,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1806.02.01,"Recognizing the human dimension on participation to environmental conservation initiatives, this study determined the socio-economic characteristics of stakeholders in Bataan Coastal Resource Management (CRM) and how these variables influence their participation in the process. Data were collected through a survey. Four variables revealed to be independent indicators of high or poor CRM participation: the stakeholdersâ€™ locality income class, age, level of education, and household size. These indicators are important matters to cogitate for they are indirect drivers of the success or failure of CRM activities. It is concluded that Bataan CRM in the Philippines needs to be reviewed to tackle socio-economic barriers to engagement. Assessment of the process of selecting Bataan CRM participants; strengthened information, education, and communication component through an enriched content and rationalized delivery; institution of a unified CRM database system; and establishment of a provincial CRM research center are all recommended to counteract stakeholder estrangement and unresponsiveness to CRM efforts.","Ablong, W.

Perdio, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1806.02.01, abstract: Recognizing the human dimension on participation to environmental conservation initiatives, this study determined the socio-economic characteristics of stakeholders in Bataan Coastal Resource Management (CRM) and how these variables influence their participation in the process. Data were collected through a survey. Four variables revealed to be independent indicators of high or poor CRM participation: the stakeholdersâ€™ locality income class, age, level of education, and household size. These indicators are important matters to cogitate for they are indirect drivers of the success or failure of CRM activities. It is concluded that Bataan CRM in the Philippines needs to be reviewed to tackle socio-economic barriers to engagement. Assessment of the process of selecting Bataan CRM participants; strengthened information, education, and communication component through an enriched content and rationalized delivery; institution of a unified CRM database system; and establishment of a provincial CRM research center are all recommended to counteract stakeholder estrangement and unresponsiveness to CRM efforts., published date: 2018-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/324, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 6 No. 2",e6aeebd7-6e0b-4bd4-b25b-3001edadbcf2
Energy Conservation in Academic Institutions: An Application of Theory of Planned Behavior,"Energy conservation, Theory of planned behavior, antecedents of user behavior",Eugenio A. Ermac,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1806.02.02,"Energy conservation is a buzzword that cuts across a broad spectrum of stakeholders. It has been widely practiced, developed, and discussed in government, political, and industrial sectors due to its massive impact on tackling issues related to climate change and global warming as well as presenting opportunities to cut energy costs. Despite the active discussion of this topic in the literature, very few papers have discussed it in the context of academic institutions which has one of the most significant impacts in terms of energy consumption. To address the issue, this paper places the topic of energy conservation in the context of academic institutions.

Ricoeurâ€™s Hermeneutics: Transforming Political Structures into Just Institutions through the Critical Appropriation of Political Power,"Ricoeur, hermeneutics, political power, political vigilance, reflection",Alexis Deodato S. Itao,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1806.02.03,"In this paper, I aim to show that the critical appropriation of political power can be a potential tool in transforming political structures into just institutions. To achieve this aim, I employ Ricoeurâ€™s hermeneutics of symbols because in his different political essays, he consistently regards political power as akin to a symbol. Thus, for him, the critical appropriation of political power requires a hermeneutical procedure. And so in my discussion, I devote one section for Ricoeurâ€™s hermeneutics of symbols, one for his thoughts on political power, and another one for the critical appropriation of political power through the hermeneutics of symbols. To put Ricoeurâ€™s political and hermeneutical thoughts in a better light, I introduce these sections with a separate section on his philosophical anthropology. In my conclusion, I affirm that transforming political structures into just institutions is very much possible through the critical appropriation of political power. It is such a potential tool in effecting these transformations because the critical appropriation of political power involves a hermeneutical procedure that follows a three-step process of reflection. And reflection, which makes way for the critical appropriation of political power, is what ensures that power rests only in the hands of those who are more likely to advance the common good, resulting into a greater possibility for the transformation of political structures into just institutions.","Akrivoulis, D.

Factors such as slope, soil type; land cover and groundwater depth were used as input parameters. Around 98% of the existing shallow tube-wells were within the suitable area. The developed map was validated using existing irrigated areas. Results show that more than 377,000 hectares were found potentially suitable locations for shallow tube-well irrigation development. These areas are characterized with a water table depth of <6.5 m, a slope of<18%, soil textures (sandy loam, clay loam, and sandy clay). Sufficient factors in combination with the GIS tool is a great tool to carry out spatial data in land-use analysis and the use of this as a means in identifying viable locations for shallow tube-well irrigation development in other places is reliable.","Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Act of the Philippines (AFMA law) Retrieved from https://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1997/ra_8435_1997.html

Factors such as slope, soil type; land cover and groundwater depth were used as input parameters. Around 98% of the existing shallow tube-wells were within the suitable area. The developed map was validated using existing irrigated areas. Results show that more than 377,000 hectares were found potentially suitable locations for shallow tube-well irrigation development. These areas are characterized with a water table depth of <6.5 m, a slope of<18%, soil textures (sandy loam, clay loam, and sandy clay). Sufficient factors in combination with the GIS tool is a great tool to carry out spatial data in land-use analysis and the use of this as a means in identifying viable locations for shallow tube-well irrigation development in other places is reliable., published date: 2018-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/491, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 6 No. 2",f3fca0d6-01c6-487d-8f30-e4159e76a28e

Global Patterns in Spatial Expansion of Dengue Serotype-I in Response to Increasing Surface Temperature,"Dengue expansion, Surface temperature difference, Dengue virus serotype-1","Rhoniel Ryan Ymbong, Jake Joshua Chi Garces",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.01.01,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection (DENV serotypes 1-4) that imposes a serious health and economic burden in tropical and sub-tropical countries around the world. Increasing atmospheric temperature had changed the dynamics of the mosquito habitats and thereby influences distribution of these mosquito vectors. We examined the increase in the number of countries within the regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas reporting laboratory confirmed dengue cases caused by DENV-1 as a response to increasing global surface temperature difference. Data on the number of countries with confirmed reports of dengue (Messina et al. 2014) and surface temperature difference (General Circulation Model) were subjected to scatter plots and linear regression. There were 113 recorded countries across three regions (America=44, comprising the North and South; Africa=28; and Asia=41) reporting dengue incidence from 1943 to 2013, of which 98 countries (America=41; Africa=20; and Asia=37 with the inclusion of Australia) reported confirmed dengue cases caused by DENV-1. Findings suggest that the effect of temperature to the expansion of dengue varies dramatically in certain groups of country. Here, we explore three patterns (PAT) of expansion response where 1) continuous increase in temperature results into a continuous increase in the number of countries with dengue cases (PAT-A), 2) initial increase in temperature results into increase in the number of countries with dengue cases but subsequent increase in temperature results in the decline of dengue expansion (PAT-B), and 3) initial increase in temperature results into higher rate of dengue expansion but continued increase slows it down (PAT-C). PAT-A represented the majority of these countries, including 10 out of 11 countries in Southeast Asia. These results are in congruence with the past studies that supports dengue expansion to be temperature-dependent.","Adams, B., & Boots, M. (2010).

Data was analyzed using a frequency count. Â In the three vegetations sampled, 54 plant species are useful to honeybees, 27 of which are forest trees, 25 are agricultural crops, and one each is a shrub and a weed. The study ascertained 18 flowering plants as extremely important bee floras since these blossom throughout the year. March to May were identified as the honey flow periods.Â  July to September (dry season) and October to December (rainy season) were the dearth periods for honeybees in the study area.

The present investigation was conducted in three barangays in Northwestern Cagayan covering Culao, Sitio Nagbaranganan in Centro 2 and Balingit from March 2014 to April 2015. Â The study used a descriptive survey method to identify the diversity of melliferous resources and to develop a floral calendar in relation to pollen and nectar availability in the area. Data was analyzed using a frequency count. Â In the three vegetations sampled, 54 plant species are useful to honeybees, 27 of which are forest trees, 25 are agricultural crops, and one each is a shrub and a weed. The study ascertained 18 flowering plants as extremely important bee floras since these blossom throughout the year. March to May were identified as the honey flow periods.Â  July to September (dry season) and October to December (rainy season) were the dearth periods for honeybees in the study area. A floral calendar was developed based on the characteristics, abundance, time and duration of bloom of the bee flora. Â Northwestern Cagayan is suitable to initiate bee farming., published date: 2016-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/203, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 4 No. 1",ca2288ee-6e65-4dbe-a4a5-32ce6f72be9d

Various Trends on the National Development of Renewable Energy Source Affecting the Natural Resource Depletion,"Renewable energy source, natural resources, exploratory pattern analysis, country trends",Eduardo D. Piedad Jr.,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.01.05,"Renewable energy sources are foreseen to rise as they become scarce and expensive fossil fuels. Considering this thought, each country implements different strategies and national policies to support the development of renewable sources. However, these emerging developments may contribute to its depletion of natural sources. In this paper, an exploratory pattern analysis was used on 125 selected countries to determine the underlying trends on the effect of the development of renewable energy (RE) sources while utilizing the countriesâ€™ natural resources. Due to different status of each country, the trends were grouped in similar associations such as negative, positive and bell-like relationships. Developed countries showed a negative relationship where the natural resources are heavily utilized in the early stages but rapidly decreased as the RE progresses. This reflects the capability of these countries with high to very-high human development index (HDI) to invest more on advanced technologies which utilize fewer natural resources. On the other hand, the underdeveloped countries with low to moderate HDI behave in a positive relationship showing their heavily dependence on its natural resources as RE progresses. Moreover, a group of developing countries between developed and underdeveloped categories and without direct relationship to HDI showed a transition between positive to negative transition as the RE progresses.

Piedad Jr., doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.01.05, abstract: Renewable energy sources are foreseen to rise as they become scarce and expensive fossil fuels. Considering this thought, each country implements different strategies and national policies to support the development of renewable sources. However, these emerging developments may contribute to its depletion of natural sources. In this paper, an exploratory pattern analysis was used on 125 selected countries to determine the underlying trends on the effect of the development of renewable energy (RE) sources while utilizing the countriesâ€™ natural resources. Due to different status of each country, the trends were grouped in similar associations such as negative, positive and bell-like relationships. Developed countries showed a negative relationship where the natural resources are heavily utilized in the early stages but rapidly decreased as the RE progresses. This reflects the capability of these countries with high to very-high human development index (HDI) to invest more on advanced technologies which utilize fewer natural resources. On the other hand, the underdeveloped countries with low to moderate HDI behave in a positive relationship showing their heavily dependence on its natural resources as RE progresses. Moreover, a group of developing countries between developed and underdeveloped categories and without direct relationship to HDI showed a transition between positive to negative transition as the RE progresses.

Displacement and Illumination Levels Effect on Short-distance Measurement Errors of Using a Camera,"short-distance measurement error, camera-to-lens displacement, illumination, computer vision, camera, descriptive and comparative analysis","Eduardo D. Piedad Jr., Ricky B. Villeta",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.01.06,"Using a camera for measurement reading is simplified through the incorporation of computer vision application. The variations in the environmentâ€™s setting, however, may constitute to the occurrence of measurement errors. A study investigated the significant effect of changing the camera-to-lens displacements and the variations of the illumination level on the short-distance measurement reading. This is performed initially by developing an actual setup calibrated though the comparison with the hypothesized values. Then, an experiment on this calibrated setup generates the measurement results of varying the displacement positions and the illumination levels. Through descriptive and comparative statistical analysis, there is evidence that the variations of the displacement alone do not significantly change the measurement results. Similarly, the variations in the illumination levels do not also constitute significant changes on the measurement results. Hence, each of the variables bears no contribution on the occurrence of the measurement error of using camera. It is further confirmed through the two way analysis of variance that there is no significant difference on the displacement positions and illumination levels, and on their interactions. These results verified that a camera can be used as a short-distance measurement tool adequately regardless on the object-to-lens displacement positions and on the illumination levels.","Abaya, W.

The â€œResurrection of the Fleshâ€ according to Saint Augustine,,"Jose Rene C. Delariarte, OSA",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.01.09,"This paper argues that contrary to some critics, Augustine, the philosopher and pillar of the Catholic faith, did tackle resurrection [of the flesh or body] by examining some of his writings. The author traces the development of Augustineâ€™s interpretation of the resurrection of the body by examining the context and some texts in four of his works, namely, De fide et symbolo, Opus imperfectum contra Julianum, De Catechizandis Rudibus, and the Enchiridion . The researcher investigates further on: (a) Augustineâ€™s understanding of the â€œresurrection of the fleshâ€ in the Creed, (b) the developmental understanding of â€œresurrection of the fleshâ€ from the different representative texts enumerated above, and (c) the theological conclusion that one could infer from the investigation whether or not it is in consonance with the present understanding of Augustine and the present formulation as theologically accepted in the present time.","Augustinus, A. & Christopher, J.

Delariarte, OSA, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.01.09, abstract: This paper argues that contrary to some critics, Augustine, the philosopher and pillar of the Catholic faith, did tackle resurrection [of the flesh or body] by examining some of his writings. The author traces the development of Augustineâ€™s interpretation of the resurrection of the body by examining the context and some texts in four of his works, namely, De fide et symbolo, Opus imperfectum contra Julianum, De Catechizandis Rudibus, and the Enchiridion . The researcher investigates further on: (a) Augustineâ€™s understanding of the â€œresurrection of the fleshâ€ in the Creed, (b) the developmental understanding of â€œresurrection of the fleshâ€ from the different representative texts enumerated above, and (c) the theological conclusion that one could infer from the investigation whether or not it is in consonance with the present understanding of Augustine and the present formulation as theologically accepted in the present time., published date: 2016-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/146, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 4 No. 1",f72b8a47-0bf8-40f8-aaf6-e1d975e11842

Path Analysis of Climate and Tourism to the Economic Growth in the Philippines,,Helmae N. Etulle-Tapanan,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.03,"This study is an empirical validation of the economic and environmental parameters of tourism in the Philippines. The determined tourism factors to be affected by tropical depressions are: tourist arrivals, tourism employment rate and travel price. These factors had varied impacts on economic growth in terms of annual gross domestic product through: exchange rate, inflation rate, consumer price index, and employment rate. The researcher utilized a path analysis to determine which among the tourism factors had a robust effect by the tropical depression. This study also concludes the effects (both direct and indirect) of predictors to GDP. A model was established from the predictors (x) to its response (y). To demonstrate the paths from the origin to the end, a computed path coefficients were generated. The summation of value effects was determined and an effect model was established.

Etulle-Tapanan, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.03, abstract: This study is an empirical validation of the economic and environmental parameters of tourism in the Philippines. The determined tourism factors to be affected by tropical depressions are: tourist arrivals, tourism employment rate and travel price. These factors had varied impacts on economic growth in terms of annual gross domestic product through: exchange rate, inflation rate, consumer price index, and employment rate. The researcher utilized a path analysis to determine which among the tourism factors had a robust effect by the tropical depression. This study also concludes the effects (both direct and indirect) of predictors to GDP. A model was established from the predictors (x) to its response (y). To demonstrate the paths from the origin to the end, a computed path coefficients were generated. The summation of value effects was determined and an effect model was established. Findings revealed that travel price factor was a prevalent element that influenced the volatility of GDP and not more on the tourist arrivals and tourism employment rate. Tourists, regardless of nationality, prefer to spend more their money, enjoy and mesmerize the natural beauty of Philippines even with the occurrence of natural disturbances.

Tourism and Hospitality Management Students undergoing US Work and Travel Program: A Phenomenological Inquiry,"International Internship, international placement, on-line media, computer-mediated conferencing, internship experiences","Steven N. Sasam, Gelena N. Asis-Dimpas, Antoniette Dayagbil",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.11,"Tourism professionals expect universities to produce graduates who could deliver and perform functions based on industry standards. Universities have long integrated International Placements to heighten student competencies, bridge the gap between theoretical awareness and industry practice, and meet the expectations of the practitioners. However, there have been reports of unfavorable encounters of students on placement abroad such as being homesick, feeling out of place, and difficulty in reconciling expectation-reality gaps. These are the key issues that hinder students from optimizing international exposure programs and compromise the quality of their learning. A phenomenological study was used to examine the lived experiences of the tourism and hospitality management students on international placement. An in-depth interview was conducted as the primary source of data collection. The data were coded and analyzed according to the research questions. The research resulted in three (3) major themes which emerged out of the experiences shared by the student interns: 1.) struggles experienced in foreign country; 2.) skills/strategies to cope with the adversities; 3.) interns communication practices. The results of this study served as the basis in enhancing the e monitoring support system for the internship coordinator in the home university.","Aiello, J. R., & Svec, C. M. (1993).

Sasam, Gelena N. Asis-Dimpas, Antoniette Dayagbil, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.11, abstract: Tourism professionals expect universities to produce graduates who could deliver and perform functions based on industry standards. Universities have long integrated International Placements to heighten student competencies, bridge the gap between theoretical awareness and industry practice, and meet the expectations of the practitioners. However, there have been reports of unfavorable encounters of students on placement abroad such as being homesick, feeling out of place, and difficulty in reconciling expectation-reality gaps. These are the key issues that hinder students from optimizing international exposure programs and compromise the quality of their learning. A phenomenological study was used to examine the lived experiences of the tourism and hospitality management students on international placement. An in-depth interview was conducted as the primary source of data collection. The data were coded and analyzed according to the research questions. The research resulted in three (3) major themes which emerged out of the experiences shared by the student interns: 1.) struggles experienced in foreign country; 2.) skills/strategies to cope with the adversities; 3.) interns communication practices. The results of this study served as the basis in enhancing the e monitoring support system for the internship coordinator in the home university., published date: 2015-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/29, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 3 No. 1",1347275f-8ae0-44ac-9376-13688cde44d8
Insights of Conflict Management Strategies from the Perspectives of Selected Philosophers,,Glenn G. Pajares,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.12,"This study aims to draw insights and implications on conflict management strategies from selected philosophers. It utilizes textual or content analysis to present and explain what they have to say and offer about conflict management strategies. The study shows that different philosophers have varied approaches and strategies to conflict management among them are yielding, compromising, collaborating, competing, and avoiding. However, they share commonalities such as the discernment and defense of the greater good/common good over individual interests and desires; the discernment and defense of truth, rectitude, and justice over beliefs, feelings, opinions, prejudices, injustice and stereotypes; the principle of not harming others; a preventive approach to conflict management rather than curative. Therefore, philosophy is not something
abstract but offers practical strategies to manage conflict. The study is relevant because it is an additional literature on conflict management particularly from the perspective of philosophy considering that there is dearth in the literature. This study recommends that another study be made using different set of philosophers. Also, one may look into leadership or management styles reflected in the philosophy of selected philosophers.","Abel, Donald (2005). Fifty Readings Plus an Introduction to Philosophy.

This paper attempts to develop a model that could predict how many years a facility (private or government) would last based on the given number of assumptions and random data. The study used an experimental design using simulation modeling. Assumptions were formulated to measure different variables. Findings revealed that government facilities tend to deteriorate faster compared to its private counterparts. Government facilities would only last approximately up to six (6) years then reach its critical level. This is due to the assumption that only 40% of government institutions are effective workers. Low percentage of effective workers would translate to less motivation of the worker to pursue any transaction that could possibly help the current state of the facility. On the other hand, more than half of the Private facilities would last more than five years before reaching a critical level. This is due to the assumption that private workers are 20% higher compared to government workers in terms of percentage of effective workers. A highly motivated worker will always be willing to spend time, even extra time, to perform his job. Benign neglect of a less motivated workforce would result to non performance of his assigned task.

Despite the fluctuations in number of reported cases over the years, arthritis had been a rampant cause of pain to the elderly. However, therapy for this disease is considerably expensive; thus, the researchers utilized Moringa Oleifera seeds oil extract topical application as an adjunct therapy in providing relief of arthritic pain. Manual oil
press was used to extract oil. The researchers conducted three trials with four assessments in various time intervals for 30 randomized samples for each group in three different localities, utilizing the true-experimental, Pretest-Posttest design. One Way Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed p-value of 0.909 and 0.000 for Control and Experimental groups respectively. Paired T-test revealed p-value of 0.000 for Experimental groupâ€™s pre-test and post-tests. T-test of independent samples however showed significant
decrease in pain level only on 30 minutes and one hour after application. These results suggested highly significant decrease of pain perceived by subjects who received the adjunct therapy.","Adejumo, O., Kolapo, A., &Folarin, A. (2012). Moringaoleifera Lam.

Celetaria, Axl Rose R. Arnejo, Jezyl C. Cutamora, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.15, abstract: According to the Department of Health (DOH, 2011), the morbidity rate for Arthritis in the Philippines is increasing and the age group of 65 years and above has the highest morbidity. Despite the fluctuations in number of reported cases over the years, arthritis had been a rampant cause of pain to the elderly. However, therapy for this disease is considerably expensive; thus, the researchers utilized Moringa Oleifera seeds oil extract topical application as an adjunct therapy in providing relief of arthritic pain. Manual oil
press was used to extract oil. The researchers conducted three trials with four assessments in various time intervals for 30 randomized samples for each group in three different localities, utilizing the true-experimental, Pretest-Posttest design. One Way Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed p-value of 0.909 and 0.000 for Control and Experimental groups respectively. Paired T-test revealed p-value of 0.000 for Experimental groupâ€™s pre-test and post-tests. T-test of independent samples however showed significant
decrease in pain level only on 30 minutes and one hour after application. These results suggested highly significant decrease of pain perceived by subjects who received the adjunct therapy., published date: 2015-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/17, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 3 No. 1",f3a885c7-3e1c-48e1-afc6-92ebb3634cca

Ethanolic extracts of Persia americana (avocado), Psidium guajava (guava), and Moringa olifera (malunggay) were tested using the paper disc diffusion method for antibacterial agent against the common poultry pathogens Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Guava and avocado extract showed almost all the secondary metabolites screened while only flavonoids and alkaloids were present in the malunggay extract. The presence of secondary metabolites applied to broiler chicks as feed additives enhances the growth performance of the chicken. There were five treatments groups identified as distilled water,Vetracin, avocado decoction, guava decoction, and malunggay decoction. Using a statistical analysis of one- way ANOVA and Duncanâ€™s Multiple Range Test (DMRT), final weight and the weight gained has significant differences including some body parts of the chicken while the final circumferential measurement doesnâ€™t have a significant difference. Among the treatments, guava decoction had better weight yield among the experimental medicinal leaves.Therefore, this can be an alternative substitute for antibiotics in the chicken production and one way of eliminating the use of synthetic antibiotic application is through the utilization of the natural antibiotic extract from medicinal leaves which lessen the side effect in the treated animals and consumers.","Adedeji O.S., et al.

Theory of Adaptation of Educators Teaching Technology-Based Courses,"adaptation, higher education, technology-based, grounded theory",Leila Pinatil,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2311.01.08,"The need for resilience among educators has become a critical demand during the COVID-19 pandemic when in-person classes were restricted and were converted into distance learning and eventually shifted to blended learning as governments opened borders and health safety protocols eased down. Hence, this study focuses on understanding how educators of technology-based courses in public higher education across academic landscapes have navigated for continuous instructional delivery. This study utilizes the Straussian approach of Grounded Theory. This design uses a three-stage coding methodology: open, axial, and selective coding. The study generates the Theory of Educators Teaching Technology-Based Courses across academic landscapes, which postulates that educators in technology-based courses undergo phases of metamorphosis that include visioning, learning, rationalizing and doing, and modernizing, ultimately allowing them to become resilient and adaptive to the shifting landscapes of the academe caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alaidi, A.

Hence, this study focuses on understanding how educators of technology-based courses in public higher education across academic landscapes have navigated for continuous instructional delivery. This study utilizes the Straussian approach of Grounded Theory. This design uses a three-stage coding methodology: open, axial, and selective coding. The study generates the Theory of Educators Teaching Technology-Based Courses across academic landscapes, which postulates that educators in technology-based courses undergo phases of metamorphosis that include visioning, learning, rationalizing and doing, and modernizing, ultimately allowing them to become resilient and adaptive to the shifting landscapes of the academe caused by the COVID-19 pandemic., published date: 2023-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1572, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 11 No. 1",4d472793-a00b-410c-8319-12c95f0aa66c
Development and Validation of E-SelfIMo: E-Learning Self-Directed Interactive Module in Earth Science,"adaptation, higher education, technology-based, grounded theory",Nestor Jr. Lasala,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2311.01.07,"This study developed and validated E-learning Self-directed Interactive Modules (E-SelfIMo) for Earth Science. The study employed Research and Development method, using the Borg and Gall development procedure, in creating eight e-modules using Kotobee software, evaluating them by experts and students and determining their effectiveness in terms of student’s concep-tual understanding. Experts agreed that E-SelfIMo met the DepEd standards for non-printed learning materials, and students attested their high validity in content, format, and usefulness. Pretest and posttest results for the effectiveness of E-SelfIMo revealed that students exposed to the E-SelfIMo have progressed from “Near Mastery” to “Near Full Mastery” in the chosen Earth Science topics, showing more significant improvement in their conceptual understanding than the control group. This study concludes that E-SelfIMo supports interactive, active, and self-directed learning thereby, improving students’ motivation, engagement, interest, and per-formance. The E-SelfIMo could be used with technology integration as a teaching and learning tool.","Abadi, M. K., Cahya, E., Jupri, A. (2017).

The study employed Research and Development method, using the Borg and Gall development procedure, in creating eight e-modules using Kotobee software, evaluating them by experts and students and determining their effectiveness in terms of student’s concep-tual understanding. Experts agreed that E-SelfIMo met the DepEd standards for non-printed learning materials, and students attested their high validity in content, format, and usefulness. Pretest and posttest results for the effectiveness of E-SelfIMo revealed that students exposed to the E-SelfIMo have progressed from “Near Mastery” to “Near Full Mastery” in the chosen Earth Science topics, showing more significant improvement in their conceptual understanding than the control group. This study concludes that E-SelfIMo supports interactive, active, and self-directed learning thereby, improving students’ motivation, engagement, interest, and per-formance. The E-SelfIMo could be used with technology integration as a teaching and learning tool., published date: 2023-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1647, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 11 No. 1",453979b5-897e-447b-9f85-d40bc71a4e0b
Applying Stakeholder and Self-Efficacy Theories to Classify Organizational Citizenship Behavior Antecedents,"emerging nation, OCB, hospitality industry, employee-led initiatives, Cebu","Tiffany Adelaine Tan, Leahlizbeth Sia, Benedict James Duran",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2311.01.04,"Most studies about organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) focus on particular actions that employees, supervisors, or owners of organizations should exhibit. To encourage OCB in service-oriented Filipino organizations, this paper proposes a classification of OCB antecedents collected from the literature in theory and industry practice. By using the stakeholder and self-efficacy theories, the proposed four clearly defined categories point out whether these antecedents are employee-led, leader-led, organization-led, or HR-led initiatives. Since it would be burdensome for an individual to know all the factors that may influence OCB, categorizing these antecedents will help the individual to identify the behavioral aspects that he or she has control over.

This study used the survey approach for descriptive-correlational research involving rural banks’ eighty managers or key employees who are knowledgeable about sustainability policies. The researcher employed quantitative tools to analyze the survey's hypothesis. The associations between the variables of a research model were examined using multiple regression analysis. In addition to conducting structured surveys, the researcher examined secondary data on rural banks' financial performance from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas website. Results revealed that sustainable and sound environmental banking practices as well as their capital and loan portfolios significantly influence financial performance.

Cabaron, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2311.01.03, abstract: While rural banks have business strategies to generate and exploit opportunities, they also need to consider economic, social, and environmental facets for sustainability. This study used the survey approach for descriptive-correlational research involving rural banks’ eighty managers or key employees who are knowledgeable about sustainability policies. The researcher employed quantitative tools to analyze the survey's hypothesis. The associations between the variables of a research model were examined using multiple regression analysis. In addition to conducting structured surveys, the researcher examined secondary data on rural banks' financial performance from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas website. Results revealed that sustainable and sound environmental banking practices as well as their capital and loan portfolios significantly influence financial performance. Thus, the current study suggested a sustainable banking model for Philippine rural banks., published date: 2023-05-05, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1351, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 11 No. 1",a102e2b1-2bd1-400d-95c2-a20fd5cce80f

Ceballos, Erick T. Baloran, Milton Norman D. Medina",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2311.01.05,"Using primarily comparative evidence of mental health situation during the COVID-19 pandemic between a Southeast Asian and a European Country, this study was conducted among public and private schools in the Philippines and Latvia, Europe, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic utilizing a standardized Depression, Anxiety, and Stress (DAS) questionnaire. Findings revealed that Latvian teachers experienced higher cases of depression, anxiety, and stress than Filipino teachers. In contrast, Latvian students exhibit lower cases of depression and anxiety than Filipino students. Thus, mental health conditions of both teachers and students of both countries must be prioritized by conducting various programs and activities which further demands that mental health must be considered in academic institutions because when human resource knows how to deal with depression, anxiety, and stress, they also make better choices in life which will make them corollarily become even more productive at work.","Acob, J.

Ceballos, Erick T. Baloran, Milton Norman D. Medina, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2311.01.05, abstract: Using primarily comparative evidence of mental health situation during the COVID-19 pandemic between a Southeast Asian and a European Country, this study was conducted among public and private schools in the Philippines and Latvia, Europe, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic utilizing a standardized Depression, Anxiety, and Stress (DAS) questionnaire. Findings revealed that Latvian teachers experienced higher cases of depression, anxiety, and stress than Filipino teachers. In contrast, Latvian students exhibit lower cases of depression and anxiety than Filipino students. Thus, mental health conditions of both teachers and students of both countries must be prioritized by conducting various programs and activities which further demands that mental health must be considered in academic institutions because when human resource knows how to deal with depression, anxiety, and stress, they also make better choices in life which will make them corollarily become even more productive at work., published date: 2023-06-20, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1328, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 11 No. 1",33263adb-833a-41c2-afe7-16c973317f6f
Bio-efficacy of Trichoderma harzianum Rifai and Botanical Extracts against Major Fungal Pathogens of Tamarind (Tamarindus indica L.) under Field Condition,"biocontrol, botanical extracts, major fungal diseases, tamarind, Philippines","Mary Grace Gatan, Aneska Bulanadi, Mary Angelica Rose Limpin, Menrado Gatan, Cesar Orpiada",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2311.01.02,"Domestic production of tamarind has decreased in the country due to diseases. Tests were made on the individual efficacy of botanical extracts like plant growth promoter (PGP) and oriental herb nutrient (OHN), as well as the Trichoderma harzianum Rifai as a possible biocontrol agent against major fungal tamarind diseases. Using Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD), a field setup was established with five treatments: untreated (negative control), synthetic fungicide, OHN, PGP, and T. harzianum having three replications per treatment. Results revealed that T. harzianum is an effective biocontrol agent against major fungal tamarind diseases. PGP having similar efficiency with T. harzianum significantly inhibited the infection and provided immediate defense from diseases. OHN is less effective due to delayed reduced infection. The research output is a significant help in the management of various diseases that is cost-effective and safe.","Abdulkadir, A., Hayatu, M., Sani, L. A., & Ahmed, H. (2022).

Modern robots can do complex tasks and are the central components of Industry 4.0. These improvements make robots applicable in a variety of fields like security, exploration, entertainment, agriculture, healthcare and industry. While advancements in robotics come with many advantages, it still faces roadblocks that hinder its development or implementation. To aid in the public acceptance and adoption of robotics in the industry, policy development is critical to minimize the social and economic effects. Several policy recommendations were made such as improved government support, wage insurance, upskilling programs, information dissemination, and robot tax, which would accelerate robotics development, bolster job security, publicize key information, and stabilize taxation.","Anagaran, J.-J.

Modern robots can do complex tasks and are the central components of Industry 4.0. These improvements make robots applicable in a variety of fields like security, exploration, entertainment, agriculture, healthcare and industry. While advancements in robotics come with many advantages, it still faces roadblocks that hinder its development or implementation. To aid in the public acceptance and adoption of robotics in the industry, policy development is critical to minimize the social and economic effects. Several policy recommendations were made such as improved government support, wage insurance, upskilling programs, information dissemination, and robot tax, which would accelerate robotics development, bolster job security, publicize key information, and stabilize taxation., published date: 2023-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1418, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 11 No. 1",755fd58f-e564-4bb6-84bc-a878ef4817ff

Non-Random Walk Behavior of Philippine Stock Prices,"Random walk, unit root, autocorrelations, sequences, reversals, runs",Rhenozo Barte,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.02.02,"Random walk has been held as a sufficient condition for describing the stock market as efficient, which implies that investors cannot predict the market returns or equivalently, abnormal profits cannot be obtained just by knowing the past prices. This study tests the random walk hypothesis in the case of Philippine Stock Prices, using the daily PSE index (PSEi) covering the period 03 January 2005-16 February 2016. Main results, employing the informal or visual methods such as plot analysis of log returns and correlogram, suggest some initial evidence of non-randomness. The formal methods, employing tests for unit root, runs, sequences and reversals, variance ratio, and autocorrelations, show that the PSEi prices do not follow a random walk behavior.","Journals

This study tests the random walk hypothesis in the case of Philippine Stock Prices, using the daily PSE index (PSEi) covering the period 03 January 2005-16 February 2016. Main results, employing the informal or visual methods such as plot analysis of log returns and correlogram, suggest some initial evidence of non-randomness. The formal methods, employing tests for unit root, runs, sequences and reversals, variance ratio, and autocorrelations, show that the PSEi prices do not follow a random walk behavior., published date: 2015-12-03, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/115, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 3 No. 2",ee33202d-be7f-4d75-8803-da8651125dd6

Morality and Religiosity: A Filipino Experience,"morality, religiosity, human person, relevance of morality and religiosity",Sheldon Ives G. Agaton,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.02.07,"The concepts of morality and religiosity have been associated with each other in a manner that these two co-exist and they are of equal importance for a human personâ€™s eventual ideal character. Accordingly, moral philosophy teaches that a personâ€™s moral foundation can be linked to his spiritual foundation and vice versa as one of religionsâ€™ thrusts is construct the moral fibers necessary for manâ€™s ethical existence. A human personâ€™s spirituality and morality are substantial parts of his nature that he has to learn, nourish and value them so that he may develop into an ideal human person that he is suppose to be. He does not only have to indoctrinate and inculcate one of which and despise the other. This paper generally talks about the notions of Morality and Religiosity. Further, it also discusses on the interrelation of the two as the human person applies the same to actual convictions in life. Finally, a category is presented on what a person should ideally be as the two concepts are intertwined. This paper utilized the expository-descriptive type of research. Books, articles and other similar write-ups from the library, internet and other sources coupled with observations in the experiential world were the primary references.

Agaton, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.02.07, abstract: The concepts of morality and religiosity have been associated with each other in a manner that these two co-exist and they are of equal importance for a human personâ€™s eventual ideal character. Accordingly, moral philosophy teaches that a personâ€™s moral foundation can be linked to his spiritual foundation and vice versa as one of religionsâ€™ thrusts is construct the moral fibers necessary for manâ€™s ethical existence. A human personâ€™s spirituality and morality are substantial parts of his nature that he has to learn, nourish and value them so that he may develop into an ideal human person that he is suppose to be. He does not only have to indoctrinate and inculcate one of which and despise the other. This paper generally talks about the notions of Morality and Religiosity. Further, it also discusses on the interrelation of the two as the human person applies the same to actual convictions in life. Finally, a category is presented on what a person should ideally be as the two concepts are intertwined. This paper utilized the expository-descriptive type of research. Books, articles and other similar write-ups from the library, internet and other sources coupled with observations in the experiential world were the primary references. Such method was facilitative in the full realization of this research paper., published date: 2015-12-03, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/113, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 3 No. 2",763e56fe-e04d-4b9f-8ac4-9b919043b8fa

Moral Culture in Kantâ€™s On Education (1803): Implications and Antitheses,"philosophy, Immanuel Kant, On Education, moral culture, qualitative research",Albert Albina,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.02.13,"The Philippines has been inundated with socio-politico issues that impede peopleâ€™s desire for the countryâ€™s uninterrupted progress. These issues may be complex but their antidote is contrarily simple. An answer is found in Immanuel Kantâ€™s thought on moral culture which pertains to three essential features, namely: obedience, truthfulness, and sociableness. This qualitative research focuses on the fundamental ideas in the section on moral culture in Kantâ€™s On Education. As my contribution to the fund of knowledge, I proceed by establishing the implications and antitheses of the three features of Kantâ€™s moral culture. A discussion on obedience differentiates its two kinds: absolute and voluntary. Absolute obedience is the result of compulsion by a command, while voluntary obedience is the result of confidence by a reasonable will. It is impossible to think of character formation without also thinking of truthfulness. Kant asserts that a man who tells lies has no character. Sociableness emphasizes on the importance of building relationships and friendships. The researcher contends that these three features of moral culture have corresponding antitheses: violation of laws of the land for obedience; lying and dishonesty (highest form is corruption in politics) for truthfulness; and human rights violation (highest form is war) for sociableness. Finally, these features are imperative in forging peace and social order which usher to a kind of development that people aspire.","Blackburn, Keith & Forgues-Puccio, Gonzalo F. (2009).

These issues may be complex but their antidote is contrarily simple. An answer is found in Immanuel Kantâ€™s thought on moral culture which pertains to three essential features, namely: obedience, truthfulness, and sociableness. This qualitative research focuses on the fundamental ideas in the section on moral culture in Kantâ€™s On Education. As my contribution to the fund of knowledge, I proceed by establishing the implications and antitheses of the three features of Kantâ€™s moral culture. A discussion on obedience differentiates its two kinds: absolute and voluntary. Absolute obedience is the result of compulsion by a command, while voluntary obedience is the result of confidence by a reasonable will. It is impossible to think of character formation without also thinking of truthfulness. Kant asserts that a man who tells lies has no character. Sociableness emphasizes on the importance of building relationships and friendships. The researcher contends that these three features of moral culture have corresponding antitheses: violation of laws of the land for obedience; lying and dishonesty (highest form is corruption in politics) for truthfulness; and human rights violation (highest form is war) for sociableness. Finally, these features are imperative in forging peace and social order which usher to a kind of development that people aspire., published date: 2015-12-03, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/112, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 3 No. 2",a620f818-10f3-4151-ba3e-3eaf242c3bf8

Agcaoili, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.02.02, abstract: The application of magnetic technology to agricultural productions is considered new breakthroughs to the enhancement of food production. However, studies about its application on the hydroponic system of production on high valued crops are limited. Hence, the present study assessed the effect of magnetically-treated water on the growth and yield parameters of lettuce in hydroponic system. Magnetic device with different number of permanent magnets was used to magnetize irrigation water in the hydroponic system. Uniform and healthy seedlings are transplanted and arranged completely randomized design. Magnetically treated water enhanced the growth and yield parameters of lettuce such as weekly height, leaf area, fresh weight, and root length. The height, leaf area, fresh weight, and root length increased up to 44.30%, 199.93%, 50.72%, and 37.00%, respectively vs. the control. Results revealed that magnetic treatment for water in hydroponic system has potentials to increase the growth of lettuce and consequently its yield., published date: 2019-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/772, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 7 No. 2",913293a3-1b88-4ca2-a9eb-68dd5d778257

Thus, teaching the meanings of Catholic beliefs and practices should be enriched with practical relevance so students would consider them not merely as part of Catholic rituals., published date: 2019-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/766, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 7 No. 2",58a947e8-433b-4522-9717-fedb7d9d0277

Thus, a multicenter and interdisciplinary study was employed on 501 students from six state universities in the Philippines. A questionnaire structured to assess the perception of the students as to the severity of identified stressors) as well as the prevalence of the coping mechanisms they adopt to overcome stress was used. The results indicated that academic stressors proved to be the main contributory factor to levels of distress among undergraduates. Educators and decision-makers should tailor regular student evaluations and programs that ensure the impediment of the sources of stress and other measures for further prevention., published date: 2019-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/714, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 7 No. 2",64a812e5-3e1c-4bae-8c44-8ca61c0ebb14

In the present day society where morality may vary from one understanding to another, there is a risk that its conception may be misconstrued by certain individuals. It is important in order for man to have a better understanding of what a moral life should be. A person who possesses a significant understanding of a moral theory like the Socratic ethics will have an underlying ethical foundation essential in facing situations that threaten his moral standards and beliefs. It is a fact that culture may play a role in the consideration of morality for a particular society, but this paper will focus on the individual personâ€™s concept of morality as taught by Socrates. Ethical Intellectualism is a standard of morality that may be imbibed and applied by the human person. It is an ancient method that can still hold true until today.

Agaton, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1705.01.05, abstract: A moral life is indispensable to every human person. In the present day society where morality may vary from one understanding to another, there is a risk that its conception may be misconstrued by certain individuals. It is important in order for man to have a better understanding of what a moral life should be. A person who possesses a significant understanding of a moral theory like the Socratic ethics will have an underlying ethical foundation essential in facing situations that threaten his moral standards and beliefs. It is a fact that culture may play a role in the consideration of morality for a particular society, but this paper will focus on the individual personâ€™s concept of morality as taught by Socrates. Ethical Intellectualism is a standard of morality that may be imbibed and applied by the human person. It is an ancient method that can still hold true until today. This paper is an interpretation Socratesâ€™ Ethical Intellectualism regarding a moral person side by side with every individual personâ€™s ideal state of moral life., published date: 2017-10-12, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/205, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 5 No. 1",4a6ad41f-7995-48f8-a65b-037ce0667416

On the other hand, kiln drying may avoid these circumstances. However, smoke deposits in the finished product still cause farmers to have low-quality grade copra. Keeping this in view, an indirect heat copra dryer with phase changer (IHCDPC) was designed, fabricated, and evaluated in the hopes of providing farmers an alternative approach in drying copra, which may yield to producing a high-quality grade product. The developed IHCDPC was able to reduce the moisture content in fresh coconut meat from 57.4% w.b. to about 7.2% w.b. for a drying time of twenty-five hours. The IHCDPC was found out to have a thermal efficiency of 30.87%. The copra produced were graded as 84% MGC1, 13% MGC2, and 3% MGC3.","Ayyappan, S & Mayilsamy, K. (2010). Experimental

Keeping this in view, an indirect heat copra dryer with phase changer (IHCDPC) was designed, fabricated, and evaluated in the hopes of providing farmers an alternative approach in drying copra, which may yield to producing a high-quality grade product. The developed IHCDPC was able to reduce the moisture content in fresh coconut meat from 57.4% w.b. to about 7.2% w.b. for a drying time of twenty-five hours. The IHCDPC was found out to have a thermal efficiency of 30.87%. The copra produced were graded as 84% MGC1, 13% MGC2, and 3% MGC3., published date: 2019-06-03, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/619, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 7 No. 1",a031af52-2ce8-41ff-9c6c-bfa87112bc0a
Assessing Applicant Employability Using Social Media for Talent Acquisition and Recruitment in IT/BPM Companies,"social media, background check, cyber-vetting, character assessment",Jovelyn C Cuizon,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.01.04,"The study aims to assess the extent of social media usage in talent acquisition in IT/BPM companies in Cebu and evaluate the insights of the applicants on the practice of using social media in character assessment for hiring decision. The quantitative method was employed to obtain data from two groups of respondents which constitute thirty hiring managers and ninety-six applicants. The study found that while hiring managers moderately practice social media background check to obtain additional information about the applicant, they seldom used it in hiring decisions because of the lack of formal or informal policy allowing or restricting the use of social media for that purpose. It is also found that there is a significant difference in perception between hiring managers and prospective applicants on usergenerated content on candidate social media profile.","Abate, D.

Here, the toxicity of C. cebuense leaf extract (CCLE) was evaluated using brine shrimp lethality assay (BSLA) and anthelminthic assay under a complete randomized design with equal replications. Results in BSLA revealed an LC50 value of 7.05 Î¼g/ml (pâ‰¤0.05) which is considerably medium-toxic based on standard toxicity criterion. Influence on earthworm activity showed significant difference (pâ‰¤0.01) among the different concentrations of the extract (100 mg/ml, 75 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, and 25 mg/ml) following a concentration-dependent response trend. Results suggest strong toxicity against earthworms at 75â€“100 mg/ml while having a moderate to weak toxicity at 25â€“50mg/ml. Both assays were able to elucidate toxicity of CCLE which may be due to the presence of cinnamaldehyde, the main phytochemical found in cinnamon leaves. CCLE is toxic at elevated dosages and thus warrants parallel studies using higher-vertebrate models.","Ahmed, J., Sultana N., Dewan S.M.R., Amin, M.N.

Understanding Sex Differences in Depressive Symptomatology Among Malaysian Adolescents,"adolescents, depressive symptoms, parental verbal aggression, sex, stressful life events","Sharisse May M. Barra, Rozumah Baharudin, Nor Sheereen Zulkefly, Amira Najiha Yahya, Zainal Madon",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.01.06,"Depressive symptomatology is among the major psychological problems experienced by adolescents. Sex differences in the occurrence of depressive symptoms have likewise been extensively reported in literature. However, a great majority of related research have primarily been carried out in the Western context. Hence, we conducted a study to identify the prevalence of depressive symptoms among Malaysian adolescents, and to determine its relationship with certain risk factors as well as the potential moderating role of sex. The sample comprised 964 adolescents from 20 secondary schools across Malaysia. Using logistic regression, results demonstrated that stressful life events and maternal verbal aggression significantly predicted symptoms of depression. In the moderation tests, sex significantly interacted with stressful life events and parental verbal aggression in predicting depressive symptoms. Hence, there is evidence to suggest that the depressogenic impact of stressful life events and parental verbal aggression on depressive symptomatology differs between male and female adolescents.","Agoston, A.

Barra, Rozumah Baharudin, Nor Sheereen Zulkefly, Amira Najiha Yahya, Zainal Madon, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1907.01.06, abstract: Depressive symptomatology is among the major psychological problems experienced by adolescents. Sex differences in the occurrence of depressive symptoms have likewise been extensively reported in literature. However, a great majority of related research have primarily been carried out in the Western context. Hence, we conducted a study to identify the prevalence of depressive symptoms among Malaysian adolescents, and to determine its relationship with certain risk factors as well as the potential moderating role of sex. The sample comprised 964 adolescents from 20 secondary schools across Malaysia. Using logistic regression, results demonstrated that stressful life events and maternal verbal aggression significantly predicted symptoms of depression. In the moderation tests, sex significantly interacted with stressful life events and parental verbal aggression in predicting depressive symptoms. Hence, there is evidence to suggest that the depressogenic impact of stressful life events and parental verbal aggression on depressive symptomatology differs between male and female adolescents., published date: 2019-07-09, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/680, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 7 No. 1",03bcaea3-67e7-4fe5-b325-f07f2acd917b

This study applies a token economy system to a Philippine university by awarding token currency to students who contributed meaningfully in class. After course completion, an online survey was administered to the 65 participating students, of which there were 26 completed responses. There was no evidence that the token economy increased student performance. However, survey results, coupled with student feedback, suggest that using a token economy is a viable alternative to traditional methods of evaluating student participation.","Alexander, L.

Yu, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1705.02.02, abstract: Although past studies have validated the importance of active class participation in facilitating student learning, evaluating class participation remains a major issue. This study applies a token economy system to a Philippine university by awarding token currency to students who contributed meaningfully in class. After course completion, an online survey was administered to the 65 participating students, of which there were 26 completed responses. There was no evidence that the token economy increased student performance. However, survey results, coupled with student feedback, suggest that using a token economy is a viable alternative to traditional methods of evaluating student participation., published date: 2017-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/217, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 5 No. 2",8e1d49d2-06e5-4373-a83a-a5e628574a44

Madrigal, Enrique G. Oracion",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1705.02.04,"The paper assesses the solid waste management awareness, attitude, and practices of the employees and students of a Catholic higher education institution in the Philippines. Using a descriptive research design, the data were collected using a self-administered survey questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The major findings of the study show that the respondents demonstrated a very high level of awareness and attitude and high extent of practice of solid waste management. A significant difference was found in the awareness, attitude, and practices of respondents when they were grouped according to status and religion. Also, the findings established the relationship between awareness and attitude on one hand andÂ Â  the extent of practice of solid waste management. Awareness, attitudes, and practices were significantly related to age and educational level, except for sex which showed no correlation with attitude and practices. Generally, this paper validates how knowledge influences attitude that subsequently determines behavior particularly in solid waste management as intervened by appropriate environmental education.","Adeolu, A.

Madrigal, Enrique G. Oracion, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1705.02.04, abstract: The paper assesses the solid waste management awareness, attitude, and practices of the employees and students of a Catholic higher education institution in the Philippines. Using a descriptive research design, the data were collected using a self-administered survey questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The major findings of the study show that the respondents demonstrated a very high level of awareness and attitude and high extent of practice of solid waste management. A significant difference was found in the awareness, attitude, and practices of respondents when they were grouped according to status and religion. Also, the findings established the relationship between awareness and attitude on one hand andÂ Â  the extent of practice of solid waste management. Awareness, attitudes, and practices were significantly related to age and educational level, except for sex which showed no correlation with attitude and practices. Generally, this paper validates how knowledge influences attitude that subsequently determines behavior particularly in solid waste management as intervened by appropriate environmental education., published date: 2017-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/312, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 5 No. 2",e33cd284-4dd7-4997-a52f-3c18a9503725
The Future of Nietzscheâ€™s Perspectivism as Political Consensus,"Nietzsche, Perspectivism, Paradoxes, Political Consensus, Postmodernism",Jan Gresil Kahambing,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1705.02.05,"In this paper, I delve on Nietzscheâ€™s concept of perspectivism and how it becomes relevant amid contemporary societyâ€™s openness to relative standpoints. The foremost era that reflects this description points to postmodernism as a politics of difference. Nietzscheâ€™s perspectivism is generally a critique of the conditions that absolutize truth. While this may seem a valiant opening for a welcoming era on an epistemological standpoint, it does not however do away with its own paradoxes. I contend whether this fits well with postmodernism and its ironic relationship to truth and asserts further that the conditions for Nietzscheâ€™s perspectivism can only achieve its future if it hermeneutically stands as political consensus.

In this convergent mixed-method design, the researchers determined the SHS Chemistry teachersâ€™ (n=30) knowledge, perceptions, GC integration in Chemistry topics, and challenges in teaching Green Chemistry Education (GCE). Complementary quantitative and qualitative results showed valid and reliable findings, claiming that teachers have limited preconceived knowledge on GCE but perceived it as an essential part of the teaching-learning process. Awareness of chemical hazards and their impacts on the environment is often demonstrated but rarely elaborated during discussions in Chemistry classes. Problems encountered in teaching GCE were also identified. A moderate positive correlation between the teachersâ€™ knowledge and their GC perception was observed. However, no significant relationship was found when the teachersâ€™ knowledge and perception were correlated to GC integration.","Ajewole G.A., Nzewi U., & Aganga A.B. (2009).

However, the extent of integration in the science curriculum is not widely known in the Philippines. In this convergent mixed-method design, the researchers determined the SHS Chemistry teachersâ€™ (n=30) knowledge, perceptions, GC integration in Chemistry topics, and challenges in teaching Green Chemistry Education (GCE). Complementary quantitative and qualitative results showed valid and reliable findings, claiming that teachers have limited preconceived knowledge on GCE but perceived it as an essential part of the teaching-learning process. Awareness of chemical hazards and their impacts on the environment is often demonstrated but rarely elaborated during discussions in Chemistry classes. Problems encountered in teaching GCE were also identified. A moderate positive correlation between the teachersâ€™ knowledge and their GC perception was observed. However, no significant relationship was found when the teachersâ€™ knowledge and perception were correlated to GC integration., published date: 2021-12-01, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1061, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 9 No. 2",8d584972-d3b0-4480-8dbd-8cbe01bb175d

Visayan Philosophy of Labor: A Reflection from the Notion of Kahimtang and John Paul IIâ€™s Philosophy,"Kahimtang, Labor, John Paul II, Filipino Philosophy, Visayan Philosophy","Arian G. Acampado, Glenn G. Pajares",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.02.07,"This paper highlights John Paul IIâ€™s (JPII) Philosophy of Labor and points out the need to have a Visayan philosophy of labor. Moreover, this proposes to view and analyze the Visayan philosophy of labor within the context of the Visayan notion of kahimtang. The researchers believe that the word kahimtang can be viewed as a combination of three words ka, himu and butang, in which himu connotes a concept of work. Furthermore, within the compatibilist minds of the Visayan, himu (labor) plays a significant role to redirect oneâ€™s kahimtang. Work (labor), for the Visayan, is an essential expression of freedom which has a similar expression to JPIIâ€™s Philosophy of Labor.","Acaali, C. (1997). A study of John Paul IIâ€™s theology

Acampado, Glenn G. Pajares, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.02.07, abstract: This paper highlights John Paul IIâ€™s (JPII) Philosophy of Labor and points out the need to have a Visayan philosophy of labor. Moreover, this proposes to view and analyze the Visayan philosophy of labor within the context of the Visayan notion of kahimtang. The researchers believe that the word kahimtang can be viewed as a combination of three words ka, himu and butang, in which himu connotes a concept of work. Furthermore, within the compatibilist minds of the Visayan, himu (labor) plays a significant role to redirect oneâ€™s kahimtang. Work (labor), for the Visayan, is an essential expression of freedom which has a similar expression to JPIIâ€™s Philosophy of Labor., published date: 2021-12-03, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/985, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 9 No. 2",808fb052-117a-4ebb-af12-1e56b5f27365
Challenges and Opportunities in Philippine Tourism amid the COVID-19 Pandemic,"tourism, tourism industry, challenges and opportunities, COVID-19, Philippines","Deoan D. Andulana, Mayuan T. Calijan, Albert C. Albina",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj.2109.02.08,"This exploratory study aims to discuss the multifaceted challenges and opportunities of the Philippine tourism industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges and opportunities are organized by following the elements of anti-pandemic strategies in the COVID-19 Management Framework. Some pressing challenges are the decline in tourism demand, layoff of workers, demand for online/digital transactions, avoidance of tourists to occupy hotel rooms used as quarantine facilities, and compliance of disaster management and control preparedness protocols. However, tourism industry can thrive through ample opportunities like exploring local tourism, training employees on digital services and on safety protocols, rebuilding company brand, improving business facilities, adapting to modern technology, and collaborating with consultants on disaster and risk management. These challenges and opportunities provide the bases for suggestions and recommendations
to improve policies for future pandemic planning to cushion any potential impact on the tourism industry.","Ackehurst, M., & Loveder, P. (2015). Building the

Lusong, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.02.05, abstract: The food safety compliance and challenges of microâ€“Food Business Operators (FBOs) that could impact COVID-19 are assessed in this study using the descriptive-comparative research design. The findings reveal that the sanitary conditions of utensils and equipment, the sanitary operations and facilities, the monitoring of time and temperatures, and the maintenance of the sanitary conditions in the facility need major improvement to increase food safety compliance and to contribute in mitigating the transmission of COVID-19. Minor improvements are needed in the handwashing facility, the implementation of the water potability program, Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures, personnel disease control, and hygienic practices. Moreover, the lack of technical knowledge and time to manage and continuously improve food safety system are the challenges experienced by the FBOs. These findings are instrumental to the improvement of the food safety practices, formulation of relevant policies, and conceptualization of research in mitigating COVID-19 relevant to food safety., published date: 2021-12-01, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/959, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 9 No. 2",55fc454b-bf67-4490-8b5d-85a67d0e398c

Thus, this study is conceptualized to calculate the rice machinery requirement and the mechanization level of La Union, Philippines. The utilization rate of existing machinery considers 100% and 70% in case the calculation is surplus. Furthermore, this aims to validate if there is no machinery requirement despite the 30% decrease in utilization rate. Hence, the results have revealed a need for 674 units of riding-type transplanters, 31 units of a rice combine harvester, 422 units of recirculating dryers, and 61 units of multi-pass rice mills. The rice mechanization level is moderately mechanized. However, only tillage operation is moderately mechanized; the transplanting, harvesting, drying and milling are low mechanised. These findings could serve as bases in the formulation of policies and strategies prioritizing suitable areas for
machinery intervention in the province.","Amare, D., & Endalew, W. (2016).

Abad, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.02.01, abstract: The implementation of the Republic Act No. 11203 mandates the development of a just and appropriate agricultural mechanization strategy. Thus, this study is conceptualized to calculate the rice machinery requirement and the mechanization level of La Union, Philippines. The utilization rate of existing machinery considers 100% and 70% in case the calculation is surplus. Furthermore, this aims to validate if there is no machinery requirement despite the 30% decrease in utilization rate. Hence, the results have revealed a need for 674 units of riding-type transplanters, 31 units of a rice combine harvester, 422 units of recirculating dryers, and 61 units of multi-pass rice mills. The rice mechanization level is moderately mechanized. However, only tillage operation is moderately mechanized; the transplanting, harvesting, drying and milling are low mechanised. These findings could serve as bases in the formulation of policies and strategies prioritizing suitable areas for

Eight beam samples, with dimensions of 160 mm x 150 mm x 1400 mm are loaded and simulated under a four-point loading test until failure using a reaction framework machine. A camera is fixed at the center front view of the concrete beams to capture the deflection of the samples while testing. In each test, a dial indicator is installed and the maximum deflection is manually recorded. Based on the results, the maximum deflection values recorded by the proposed application obtained an average error of 18.38 % when compared to the manual measured results. This indicates that computer vision-based application can provide a beam-wide scale deflection performance, compared to the traditional point-based deflection reading.

Both perceptions of the importance of the online competence factors and competency levels significantly correlate with the studentsâ€™ self-report of whether or not they have learned in the course.

Mortality Analysis of Early COVID-19 Cases in the Philippines Based on Observed Demographic and Clinical Characteristics,"subgroup susceptibility, exposure, length of hospitalization, survival analysis, vaccination program",Roel F. Ceballos,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.01.09,"This study aims to determine the demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases that are highly susceptible to COVID-19 infection, with longer hospitalization and at higher risk of mortality and to provide insights that may be useful to assess the vaccination priority program and allocate hospital resources. Methods that were used include descriptive statistics, nonparametric analysis, and survival analysis. Results of the study reveal that women are more susceptible to infection while men are at risk of longer hospitalization and higher mortality. Significant risk factors to COVID-19 mortality are older age, male sex, difficulty breathing, and comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes. Patients with these combined symptoms should be considered for admission to the COVID-19 facility for proper management and care. Also, there is a significant delay in the testing and diagnosis of those who died, implying that timeliness in the testing and diagnosis of patients is crucial in patient survival.","Albert, J.R.G., Orbeta, A.C.

Ceballos, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.01.09, abstract: This study aims to determine the demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases that are highly susceptible to COVID-19 infection, with longer hospitalization and at higher risk of mortality and to provide insights that may be useful to assess the vaccination priority program and allocate hospital resources. Methods that were used include descriptive statistics, nonparametric analysis, and survival analysis. Results of the study reveal that women are more susceptible to infection while men are at risk of longer hospitalization and higher mortality. Significant risk factors to COVID-19 mortality are older age, male sex, difficulty breathing, and comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes. Patients with these combined symptoms should be considered for admission to the COVID-19 facility for proper management and care. Also, there is a significant delay in the testing and diagnosis of those who died, implying that timeliness in the testing and diagnosis of patients is crucial in patient survival., published date: 2021-05-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1047, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 9 No. 1",7e11d34a-3d9c-4713-9fd0-cefb9c83239c

The researchers used convergent mixed methods design in analysing the pre-service teachers' experience and observations in teaching through thematic instruction. Results revealed that the thematic instruction implemented in the study has the potential to address the challenges of the current K to 12 science curriculum in terms of design, lesson content, and implementation.

This descriptive correlational study determined the level of optimism, job stress, and emotional exhaustion of 150 teachers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and it analyzed the relationship among these three variables. The data were analyzed using weighted mean, standard deviation, and Pearson r. Results revealed resiliency among teachers amidst the pandemic with a high level of optimism and a relatively low COVID-19 induced job stress and emotional exhaustion level. This study has also shown that optimism is not correlated with job stress and emotional exhaustion, but it found out significant relationship between the last two variables. Generally, it can be concluded that teachers are highly optimistic amidst the pandemic. This paper also validates earlier claims that lower levels of job stress contribute to lower incidents of emotional exhaustion.","Agaibi, C., & Wilson, J. P. (2005).

Lagat, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.01.12, abstract: Despite the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers continue to navigate the new normal in education which demonstrate their resilience. This descriptive correlational study determined the level of optimism, job stress, and emotional exhaustion of 150 teachers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and it analyzed the relationship among these three variables. The data were analyzed using weighted mean, standard deviation, and Pearson r. Results revealed resiliency among teachers amidst the pandemic with a high level of optimism and a relatively low COVID-19 induced job stress and emotional exhaustion level. This study has also shown that optimism is not correlated with job stress and emotional exhaustion, but it found out significant relationship between the last two variables. Generally, it can be concluded that teachers are highly optimistic amidst the pandemic. This paper also validates earlier claims that lower levels of job stress contribute to lower incidents of emotional exhaustion., published date: 2021-06-03, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1027, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 9 No. 1",1b4aa239-e73a-4036-b3b4-af81747b6ebe
Extended Technology Acceptance Model to Examine the Use of Google Forms â€“ based Lesson Playlist in Online Distance Learning,"digital learning technology, extended technology acceptance model, COVID-19, online distance learning, Philippine Senior High School students, PLS-SEM",Fritz M. Ferran,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2109.01.13,"Shifting to online distance learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic challenged educators' roles as instructional materials designers. This study aimed to examine the students' acceptance of the teacher-designed e-learning tool called Google Forms-based Lesson Playlist (GF-LP) in a home-based online distance learning environment. This quantitative research analyzed 570 responses from Grades 11 and 12 students at a private school in the Philippines using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling. Results showed that perceived self-efficacy and system quality strongly affect the users' perceived ease of use while perceived ease of use highly influenced the students' perceived usefulness of GF-LP. Facilitating conditions do not affect the users' attitudes towards using the e-learning tool, which confirmed the effective utilization of GF-LP in online distance learning. The relationships between the original constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) were also presented. This study recommends the use of GF-LP or its features for remote learning.","Adnan, M., & Anwar, K. (2020). Online learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic: Studentsâ€™ perspectives.

This study aimed to examine the students' acceptance of the teacher-designed e-learning tool called Google Forms-based Lesson Playlist (GF-LP) in a home-based online distance learning environment. This quantitative research analyzed 570 responses from Grades 11 and 12 students at a private school in the Philippines using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling. Results showed that perceived self-efficacy and system quality strongly affect the users' perceived ease of use while perceived ease of use highly influenced the students' perceived usefulness of GF-LP. Facilitating conditions do not affect the users' attitudes towards using the e-learning tool, which confirmed the effective utilization of GF-LP in online distance learning. The relationships between the original constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) were also presented. This study recommends the use of GF-LP or its features for remote learning., published date: 2021-06-03, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/955, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 9 No. 1",aa91274f-0e11-4271-bbe5-b37d4c169f50

These medicines have been used for decades by mananambals or local folk healers and residents from low-income groups. However, because of modern treatments, the locals have started to move away from Tambal Binisaya. Because of this, many residents have become unfamiliar to Tambal Binisaya and the terms used in the trade. Thus, this ethnolinguistic study looked into the lexicon of Tambal Binisaya, specifically word formation processes involved in the names of these folk medicines. In doing so, the researcher employed interviews, observations and field notes in data gathering. Based on the results of the study, it was found that the morphological processes used are: affixation, enclitization, reduplication, metanalysis, compounding, blending, borrowing and coining. It is concluded that there indeed lies a rich trove of lexical items in Tambal Binisaya which should be given more societal and academic attention.","Bautista. M. L. (1996).

An Economic Rationalization Framework for Higher Education,"rationalization framework, HEIs, subsidy, data mining",Jezyl C. Cutamora,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.01.04,"The marginal rate of returns (MRR) of higher education programs affect a countryâ€™s economy. It is in this light that the current study primarily intends to determine which higher education programs the state should fully subsidize and which programs the private education service providers should take charge of. The net effect of this identification is to rationalize the supply side of the economy. Quantitative non-experimental retrospective explanatory design and data mining techniques were used. Consequently, based on the programsâ€™ marginal rate of returns, indeed there are certain higher education services that bring about public good while some others do not. Agriculture, services, humanities and arts, sciences, health and welfare, engineering, manufacturing and construction, and education programs demonstrate greater public good while social sciences, business, and law generally promote greater private returns to the individuals rather than to the society.","Altbach, P., Reisberg, L. and Rumbley, L .2009.

Cutamora, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.01.04, abstract: The marginal rate of returns (MRR) of higher education programs affect a countryâ€™s economy. It is in this light that the current study primarily intends to determine which higher education programs the state should fully subsidize and which programs the private education service providers should take charge of. The net effect of this identification is to rationalize the supply side of the economy. Quantitative non-experimental retrospective explanatory design and data mining techniques were used. Consequently, based on the programsâ€™ marginal rate of returns, indeed there are certain higher education services that bring about public good while some others do not. Agriculture, services, humanities and arts, sciences, health and welfare, engineering, manufacturing and construction, and education programs demonstrate greater public good while social sciences, business, and law generally promote greater private returns to the individuals rather than to the society., published date: 2020-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/848, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 8 No. 1",75ef1723-ec70-4532-9ef0-e7785e5857f3

To address such gap, this paper explores the dynamics of tourist demand in the Philippines through a case study. It illustrates the tourist arrival using a SARIMA model. Results show that the adopted methodology was able to capture the dynamics of the tourist demand in the Philippines. By providing lenses to the Philippine tourism case, this paper would help shed light to the gaps in the literatureâ€™s current understanding of tourism in the Philippines.

Using the descriptive-comparative and correlational research design, data collection involved the survey questionnaires and hypotheses-testing used the Mann Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis, and Pearson r. In general, the students demonstrated a very high extent of religiosity, but they significantly differ when compared by grade level, church involvement, mass attendance, and Catholic identity. They had moderate spiritual well-being, but a significant difference was noted between males and females. Nevertheless, a significant relationship exists between religiosity and spiritual wellbeing, which suggests that the more the students observe Catholic teachings and practices, the more they mature in God's personal experience and achieve a sense of satisfaction and purpose in life. This study provides baseline data for developing the religious education curriculum and enhancing the campus ministry programs and activities of the said school.","Abu-Raiya, H., Pargament, K.

Madrigal, Rosabella P. Erillo, Enrique G. Oracion, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.01.06, abstract: This study examined the religiosity and spiritual well-being of Catholic senior high school students of a rural Catholic school. Using the descriptive-comparative and correlational research design, data collection involved the survey questionnaires and hypotheses-testing used the Mann Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis, and Pearson r. In general, the students demonstrated a very high extent of religiosity, but they significantly differ when compared by grade level, church involvement, mass attendance, and Catholic identity. They had moderate spiritual well-being, but a significant difference was noted between males and females. Nevertheless, a significant relationship exists between religiosity and spiritual wellbeing, which suggests that the more the students observe Catholic teachings and practices, the more they mature in God's personal experience and achieve a sense of satisfaction and purpose in life. This study provides baseline data for developing the religious education curriculum and enhancing the campus ministry programs and activities of the said school., published date: 2020-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/862, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 8 No. 1",b8121a64-84ad-46f5-8120-09b54a310ab6

Corpuz,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.01.08,"Atang (food offering) is an indigenous ritual for the dead in the Northern Philippines. The atang ritual is thought to be a part of the cultural and religious contexts of the Ilocano people. This research argued that the Ilocanosâ€™ practice of atang ritual is compatible with the Catholic Doctrine on the Communion of Saints. This study utilized descriptive and contextual approaches in doing inculturation. It used the purposive sampling technique to Ilocano participants and discussed the development of doing a local theology of atang ritual in the faith of Ilocano Catholics. Results of the study revealed that the atang ritual has significant implications in the faith of the Ilocano Catholics in terms of the importance of remembering the dead as way to elaborate the doctrine of the communion of Saints. Thus, the concept of the communion of saints can be understood in the context of food offering for the dead.","Abad, R. (1995). Filipino religiosity: Some international comparisons.

The study creates a contextual chatbot named WordnetBot, a web application that utilizes the use of technologies such as Dialogflow, React, NodeJS, Javascript, and MariaDB. The Wordnet database which leverages all other dictionaries due to its semantic relations representation was used as the data source. Phrase Structure Analysis extracts the keyword and the semantic relation from a userâ€™s message or query. It complements the Machine Learning and AI capabilities of Dialogflow in the analysis. The researcher designed an architectural framework for the integration of the different components of WordnetBot., published date: 2020-12-29, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/876, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 8 No. 2",4a4c6504-6706-4991-9aa9-55e97df03e52
Analysis and Forecasting of Fire incidence in Davao City,"R programming, forecasting, fire incidence, modeling for decision making","Merlito M. Villa, Roel F. Ceballos",https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.02.03,"Fire incidence is a big problem for every local government unit in the Philippines. The two most detrimental effects of fire incidence are economic loss and loss of life. To mitigate these losses, proper planning and implementation of control measures must be done. An essential aspect of planning and control measures is prediction of possible fire incidences. This study is conducted to analyze the historical data to create a forecasting model for the fire incidence in Davao City. Results of the analyses show that fire incidence has no trend or seasonality, and occurrences of fire are neither consistently increasing nor decreasing over time. Furthermore, the absence of seasonality in the data indicate that surge of fire incidence may occur at any time of the year. Therefore, fire prevention activities should be done all year round and not just during fire prevention month.","Adhikari, R., & Agrawal, R. K. (2013).

Direct and Indirect Factors Affecting Teachersâ€™ Burnout in the New Normal,"education, perceived control, teachersâ€™ personality traits, teachersâ€™ burnout, descriptive correlational, Philippines",Andrian A. Dela Cruz,https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.02.06,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 has brought about tiring tasks and unending demands in the Philippine educational system. With the abrupt shift of the teaching-learning process, teachers are pressured and stressed, which leads them to be burned out. The descriptive correlational research design determines the direct and indirect effects of perceived control to burnout through teachersâ€™ personality traits of the 240 early childhood teachers. Data are analyzed using the Pearson r formula, Bivariate parametric correlation, and the Structural Equation Model (SEM). The study reveals that despite the challenges experienced in this time of pandemic, teachers have control over themselves and with the people around them. The teachersâ€™ level of control does not influence their burnout; instead, their burnout is dependent on their emotional stability. Thus, burnout is a personal choice which is triggered by oneâ€™s emotion. A person with high perceived control may still be burned out if he does not have control over his emotions.","Becker, E., GÃ¶tz, T., Morger, V., & Ranellucci, J. (2014).

Dela Cruz, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2008.02.06, abstract: The outbreak of the COVID-19 has brought about tiring tasks and unending demands in the Philippine educational system. With the abrupt shift of the teaching-learning process, teachers are pressured and stressed, which leads them to be burned out. The descriptive correlational research design determines the direct and indirect effects of perceived control to burnout through teachersâ€™ personality traits of the 240 early childhood teachers. Data are analyzed using the Pearson r formula, Bivariate parametric correlation, and the Structural Equation Model (SEM). The study reveals that despite the challenges experienced in this time of pandemic, teachers have control over themselves and with the people around them. The teachersâ€™ level of control does not influence their burnout; instead, their burnout is dependent on their emotional stability. Thus, burnout is a personal choice which is triggered by oneâ€™s emotion. A person with high perceived control may still be burned out if he does not have control over his emotions., published date: 2020-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/964, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 8 No. 2",d940566f-1d0a-4981-a3cc-6069057e6c36

Particular challenges faced are related to technology and internet access. As graduate work is expected to be about research tasks, subscribing to paid resources is seen as an issue. It is also crucial to recognize how the experience has caused stress for students. The experienced challenges are resolved by augmenting studentsâ€™ technological capacity, realigning personal values and perspectives, and resorting to free and open access journals to sustain research activities. The COVID-19 experience has taught graduate students the importance of technology, the significance of revisiting oneâ€™s values, and the reflection on their quest to finish their graduate studies. Lastly, assistance to graduate students can be done by proactively offering infrastructure assistance, socio-emotional support, and institutionalizing responsive and flexible communication mechanisms.

This descriptive study looked into the impact of an extension program to address the needs of the day care workers. It employed a questionnaire, unstructured interview, and focus group discussion in gathering the data. The study revealed that the parents and the social workers were responsive to the needs of the day care workers.  Seven themes emerged namely: eliciting parents and childrenâ€™s active involvement, improving collaboration and communication, learning from seminars, availing necessities and learning resources, improving pedagogical competence and practices of DCWs, and improving the learning environment. The extension program helped the day care workers established sustainable and effective day care centers through forging and sustaining strong partnerships with parents, government, and non-government organizations.","Abulon, E.
