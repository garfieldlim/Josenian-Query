This study used the survey approach for descriptive-correlational research involving rural banks’ eighty managers or key employees who are knowledgeable about sustainability policies. The researcher employed quantitative tools to analyze the survey's hypothesis. The associations between the variables of a research model were examined using multiple regression analysis. In addition to conducting structured surveys, the researcher examined secondary data on rural banks' financial performance from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas website. Results revealed that sustainable and sound environmental banking practices as well as their capital and loan portfolios significantly influence financial performance. Thus, the current study suggested a sustainable banking model for Philippine rural banks., published date: 2023-05-05, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1351, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 11 No. 1\"})"

The quantitative method was employed to obtain data from two groups of respondents which constitute thirty hiring managers and ninety-six applicants. The study found that while hiring managers moderately practice social media background check to obtain additional information about the applicant, they seldom used it in hiring decisions because of the lack of formal or informal policy allowing or restricting the use of social media for that purpose. It is also found that there is a significant difference in perception between hiring managers and prospective applicants on usergenerated content on candidate social media profile., published date: 2019-06-06, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/631, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 7 No. 1'})"

Christensen sees its relevance in many aspects of human endeavor including in education. Cheaper online education is said to be disruptive of colleges offering expensive classroom-based modes of instruction. This concern was highlighted in a forum held in Russia and attended by education leaders around the globe. Other scholars, however, dispute this. For them, it is the interruptions to the totalizing attempt of most scholarships and not the impact of technological innovations that is disrupting education. This paper supports this view, especially from the standpoint of developing countries long shackled by western-oriented paradigms., published date: 2015-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/16, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 3 No. 1'})"

It will provide recruiters an initial assessment of the candidates as well as supplementary information to support traditional recruitment and talent acquisition activities thereby reducing time and cost spent for character investigation. The application uses social media analytics to assign a social profile score. Unstructured text data are preprocessed to include only keywords which are relevant to the analysis. Word sense disambiguation is applied to determine the underlying meaning of the words. The bag-of-word is then checked for occurrence of associated words defined for each factor. Posts containing at least one occurrence of words associated with the factors are further tested for content polarity. Social character score is computed using proposed formula. The system recommends applicants based on skills and uses social character score for relevancy ranking of candidates relative to the job posts., published date: 2017-10-11, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/245, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 5 No. 1'})"

Based on the interviews with the social science and philosophy scholars and the youth leaders in the Philippines, the study identifies the following problems: Filipino identity, distortion and dysfunctionalization, manifold ambivalence, dissonance, false justification and misuse, cynicism, and decline of moral courage. Analyzed based on Hans Kelsenâ€™s concept of validity and efficacy, the problems prove to be radical given that the purported Filipino values system is actually a chaotic constellation of competing and conflicting pre-colonial, colonial, and postcolonial normative paradigms. Distorted, ambivalent, and dysfunctionalized, Filipino values and norms fail to provide effective normative guidelines. The proposed antidote of moral and values education is bound to be futile in the face of a severely mutilated social conscience., published date: 2022-05-27, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1211, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1'})"
