The present study investigates the experiences of Filipino women married to Koreans and their school parental engagement. Through unstructured interviews, 13 Filipino women participated in the study regarding their involvement in school affairs regarding their child’s attendance at Korean schools. The challenges faced by the participants were also explored. Findings show Filipino mothers’ eagerness to attend to the academic needs of their children through various programs and activities. Responsibilities and challenges faced by Filipino women span teaching their children and academic monitoring at home, despite not being fluent in Korean. Discrimination and social exclusivity have also been reported as experienced by some participants due to their multicultural backgrounds. Inputs to policy formulation have also been proposed based on the findings of the study., published date: 2023-02-02, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1408, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 11 No. 1\n",

These challenges and opportunities are organized by following the elements of anti-pandemic strategies in the COVID-19 Management Framework. Some pressing challenges are the decline in tourism demand, layoff of workers, demand for online/digital transactions, avoidance of tourists to occupy hotel rooms used as quarantine facilities, and compliance of disaster management and control preparedness protocols. However, tourism industry can thrive through ample opportunities like exploring local tourism, training employees on digital services and on safety protocols, rebuilding company brand, improving business facilities, adapting to modern technology, and collaborating with consultants on disaster and risk management. These challenges and opportunities provide the bases for suggestions and recommendations\n",

Crisol, Efren Jone J. Oledan, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.07, abstract: For generations, folk medicines have been used to cure various diseases with supernatural and naturalistic causations. With ethnographic descriptive design, mananambals, Tambal Binisaya vendors, and loyal patrons served as key informants in this qualitative study. In obtaining the data, observations, field notes, and interviews were the main instruments used to investigate inculturation, which is the underlying phenomenon behind the folk Catholicism evident in Tambal Binisaya. As such, it was revealed that there are strong pieces of evidence of pre-Christian practices in Tambal Binisaya, such as belief in abyans, balance in natural elements in the body, and even animism, which are somehow divergent from Catholic beliefs that put a premium on God and the total healing of the mind, body, and spirit. Despite these differences, Tambal Binisaya somehow integrated these aspects of the two systems into a hybrid healing practice. The indigenous have indeed been married to Catholicism in Tambal Binisaya., published date: 2022-06-08, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1220, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1\n",

Asian countries are starting to carve their names in the A-list of the growing world economy. Considering the stability of its excellent performance in a continual growth, the researchers endeavored to find out whether what a countryâ€™s economic growth is reflected in the level of satisfaction of its citizens.Using exploratory data analysis, indices pertinent relating to general perception, social trust, security, government performance, and professional relations were calculated. Results showed that countries which are generally perceived to be not doing well in terms of economy seem to exhibit a higher level of satisfaction from its citizens., published date: 2015-12-03, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/110, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 3 No. 2\n",

Oracion, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1806.01.02, abstract: Catholic education is closely linked to the evangelical mission of the Church. As such, the primary intent of Catholic education is to proclaim the message of salvation to all people. Accordingly, Catholic education aims to provide an integral formation with a religious dimension that will equip the human person to become life, work, and mission ready and attain salvation. But given the contemporary socio-economic, cultural, political, and technological milieus characterized by a secular and consumerist view and praxis, the value of Catholic education may have been obscured or affected.Â  Thus, this paper aims to investigate and analyze the views and practices of the faculty of a Catholic University about Catholic education. The purposive sampling method was used to determine the participants in the study. Using a qualitative research design, the data were gathered from the participants using the face-to-face interview method. Aided by the phenomenological method, the findings discovered semblance in the participants' views and practices of Catholic education with that of Catholic Church. Despite the observed undesirable elements that obscure and marginalize it, Catholic education faithfully remains a Catholic. But making religion as the core of the curriculum of Catholic education is still a great challenge for Catholic schools to realize. Thus, the collaboration of all stakeholders is vital to address this perennial challenge in Catholic education., published date: 2018-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/299, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 6 No. 1\n",

Benitez, Chelsea V. Cimafranca, Louisse Phillina Paz V. Gimenez, Jezyl C. Cutamora, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.02.08, abstract: Pediculosis capitis infestation, commonly known as head lice, a worldwide public health concern affecting individuals of all age groups, and prevalence in the general population can be as high as 40 percent. The main task attained in the study was the determination of the pediculicidal effects of Annona squamosa seed extract of different concentrations. Methodology utilized a true experimental design done in 3 trials; 10 live head lice were observed under each concentration of 25%, 50%, 75% atis seeds extract for the experimentation and 75% permethrin concentration as controlled group. In vitro testing was used and the subjects were placed in prepared petri dishes for experimentation. Data results found out that there is p-value of 0.067 at Î± = 0.05 for mean time elapsed (secs) for 100% head lice mortality. Significant p-level of 0.002 for pediculicidal activity for the first 5 minutes has been noted. The researchers derived up with a conclusion that Custard Apple (Annona squamosa) seed extract in 75%, 50% and 25% concentration is as effective as Commercial Pediculicide (Permethrin) in killing pediculosis Capitis. 50% concentration has comparable results to Permethrin and is the most effective due to its earlier onset\n",

Sasam, Gelena N. Asis-Dimpas, Antoniette Dayagbil, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.11, abstract: Tourism professionals expect universities to produce graduates who could deliver and perform functions based on industry standards. Universities have long integrated International Placements to heighten student competencies, bridge the gap between theoretical awareness and industry practice, and meet the expectations of the practitioners. However, there have been reports of unfavorable encounters of students on placement abroad such as being homesick, feeling out of place, and difficulty in reconciling expectation-reality gaps. These are the key issues that hinder students from optimizing international exposure programs and compromise the quality of their learning. A phenomenological study was used to examine the lived experiences of the tourism and hospitality management students on international placement. An in-depth interview was conducted as the primary source of data collection. The data were coded and analyzed according to the research questions. The research resulted in three (3) major themes which emerged out of the experiences shared by the student interns: 1.) struggles experienced in foreign country; 2.) skills/strategies to cope with the adversities; 3.) interns communication practices. The results of this study served as the basis in enhancing the e monitoring support system for the internship coordinator in the home university., published date: 2015-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/29, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 3 No. 1\n",

Baluran, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1806.01.01, abstract: Starting with the assumption that media, particularly magazines, serve as a ground that shape the ideological landscape for women representations, this paper explored feminine ideologies and representations of twelve (12) Cosmopolitan Philippines magazine covers from the year 2015. Underlying ideological structures were found not only in the linguistic but symbolic features of the text as well.Â  Employing the methodologies of multimodal critical discourse analysis, the investigation revealed emerging patterns on how women are portrayed and represented in the magazine covers.Â  The â€œfun and fearlessâ€ catchphrase that the magazine has shaped to define the modern Filipina (a) presents them as hypersexualized and practicing adventurous sex, (b) positions them as followers of health and beauty regimens and glamorous lifestyle that ultimately lead to the affirmation of the opposite sex, and (c) objectifies them through come-hither poses and scantily-clad bodies that emphasize the cleavage, toned abdomens, and legs.Â  The paper also discussed the possible implications brought about by the perpetuation of these ideological structures., published date: 2018-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/274, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 6 No. 1\n",

Tajonera, Dennis V. Madrigal, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.05, abstract: This descriptive-correlational study assesses the psycho-spiritual well-being of junior high school students at Catholic Schools in Central Philippines. Also, it determines the relationship between the said constructs, and at the same, their association between the variables of sex, family structure, birth order, religious affiliation, and church involvement. The data are gathered using Ryffâ€™s Psychological Well-being and Ellison and Paloutzianâ€™s Spiritual Well-being Scale. The findings reveal moderate levels of psychological and spiritual well-being among the respondents. Point biserial shows that a significant relationship existed between the demographics of family structure and psychological well-being and between church involvement and psychological well-being. Rank biserial shows, on the other hand, that there is a significant relationship between family structure and spiritual well-being and between church involvement and spiritual well-being. Also, Spearman Rank Correlation results indicated that there is a relationship between psychological well-being and spiritual well-being., published date: 2022-05-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1188, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1\n",
