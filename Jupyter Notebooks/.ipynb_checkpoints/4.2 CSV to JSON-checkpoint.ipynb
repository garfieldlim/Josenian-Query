The experiment was set out in a split-plot organized in a Randomized Complete Block Design with production management practices as the main plot and cutting heights of ratoon crop as the subplot treatment. Production management practices notably affected all agronomic characteristics, yield, and yield component parameters evaluated except the grain yield. Cutting height remarkably influenced all growth and yield parameters tested except panicle weight. Economic analysis revealed that the improved method achieved a higher gross margin (PHP21,321.60) than the farmerâ€™s practice (PHP15,419.40) because of the formerâ€™s high productivity (1.64 t ha-1). A cutting height of 45.0 cm under the improved method obtained the highest gross margin (PHP28,677.00).

Jardenil, Dennis V. Madrigal, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj2210.01.02, abstract: This phenomenological research was conducted to inquire into the experiences of fathers of children with autism during the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study was explored because there is a dearth of studies focusing on paternal involvement and a lack of local autism research. Nine participants, who were chosen using purposive sampling, individually participated in an unstructured interview. The van Kaam method popularized by Moustakas was used to analyze the data gathered. Five major themes emerged: recognizing the child's needs, surviving hardships, enduring exhaustion, encountering silver linings, and moving forward. The findings showed that fathers of children with autism encountered challenging and fulfilling events during the pandemic with resilience.

       "   'Abstract': \"This phenomenological research was conducted to inquire into the experiences of fathers of children with autism during the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study was explored because there is a dearth of studies focusing on paternal involvement and a lack of local autism research. Nine participants, who were chosen using purposive sampling, individually participated in an unstructured interview. The van Kaam method popularized by Moustakas was used to analyze the data gathered. Five major themes emerged: recognizing the child's needs, surviving hardships, enduring exhaustion, encountering silver linings, and moving forward. The findings showed that fathers of children with autism encountered challenging and fulfilling events during the pandemic with resilience. Fathers of children with autism prioritized familial needs, especially of the child, and increased their presence in the household.

In addition, they show that the determinants such as other income (p-value=0.024), length of service (p-value=0.099), as well as reward and recognition (p-value=0.015), are significant influences to employeesâ€™ retention. Hence, these conclude that better remuneration (and the increase thereof) are more likely to retain existing employees and attract employees from other organizations. Furthermore, the study specifically recommends that employee retention be improved by further refining reward and recognition that surely meet the needs and well-being of the employees., published date: 2022-06-27, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/1070, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 10 No. 1'),\n",

Hence, fake news has become prevalent as people rely on information explored online. This research aims to examine the social-cultural impacts of fake news adaptation behavior from the social psychological perspective by investigating the relationship between collectivism, social support, sense of belonging, social endorsement, fear of missing out, perceived credibility, issue involvement, and adaptation on fake news among young adults in Malaysia. A quantitative research approach with an online self-administered survey was conducted, and 451 responses were obtained through snowball sampling. In the data analysis, measurement and structural equation modeling were adopted. Findings showed that the relationships among adaptation behaviors on fake news were significantly supported.

Hence, fake news has become prevalent as people rely on information explored online. This research aims to examine the social-cultural impacts of fake news adaptation behavior from the social psychological perspective by investigating the relationship between collectivism, social support, sense of belonging, social endorsement, fear of missing out, perceived credibility, issue involvement, and adaptation on fake news among young adults in Malaysia. A quantitative research approach with an online self-administered survey was conducted, and 451 responses were obtained through snowball sampling. In the data analysis, measurement and structural equation modeling were adopted. Findings showed that the relationships among adaptation behaviors on fake news were significantly supported.

Ortega, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.02.04, abstract: This paper presents an optimal dispatch of battery storage and its economic viability with a photovoltaic system. There are four modelled scenarios based on the combination of interruptible load program and the time-of-use scheme. The scenarios were modelled using a Binary Particle Swarm Optimization and were simulated using Matlab v6. In all the scenarios, this model successfully optimizes the battery dispatch scheduling while simultaneously minimizes the DUâ€™s penalty from exceeding the maximum allowable power demand. This algorithm also optimizes the linearly forecasted demand for the next six year for all the scenarios. Then, an economic analysis for the possible investment to the combined BESS and PV system is conducted through the comparison of the payback periods of each scenario. The first scenario is implemented without ILP and a ToU scheme and has 79.86 payback years. With ILP scheme only, the second scenario has 33.37 payback years. Then the third scenario with ToU scheme only has a 30.29 payback years. Finally, the fourth scenario, with both ILP and ToU schemes, shows the fastest recovery of the investment with 21.57 payback years. Thus the combination of both ILP and ToU schemes provide the best economic benefit.

Perdio, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1806.02.01, abstract: Recognizing the human dimension on participation to environmental conservation initiatives, this study determined the socio-economic characteristics of stakeholders in Bataan Coastal Resource Management (CRM) and how these variables influence their participation in the process. Data were collected through a survey. Four variables revealed to be independent indicators of high or poor CRM participation: the stakeholdersâ€™ locality income class, age, level of education, and household size. These indicators are important matters to cogitate for they are indirect drivers of the success or failure of CRM activities. It is concluded that Bataan CRM in the Philippines needs to be reviewed to tackle socio-economic barriers to engagement. Assessment of the process of selecting Bataan CRM participants; strengthened information, education, and communication component through an enriched content and rationalized delivery; institution of a unified CRM database system; and establishment of a provincial CRM research center are all recommended to counteract stakeholder estrangement and unresponsiveness to CRM efforts., published date: 2018-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/324, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 6 No. 2',\n",

Data were collected through a survey. Four variables revealed to be independent indicators of high or poor CRM participation: the stakeholdersâ€™ locality income class, age, level of education, and household size. These indicators are important matters to cogitate for they are indirect drivers of the success or failure of CRM activities. It is concluded that Bataan CRM in the Philippines needs to be reviewed to tackle socio-economic barriers to engagement. Assessment of the process of selecting Bataan CRM participants; strengthened information, education, and communication component through an enriched content and rationalized delivery; institution of a unified CRM database system; and establishment of a provincial CRM research center are all recommended to counteract stakeholder estrangement and unresponsiveness to CRM efforts.'},\n",

It has been widely practiced, developed, and discussed in government, political, and industrial sectors due to its massive impact on tackling issues related to climate change and global warming as well as presenting opportunities to cut energy costs. Despite the active discussion of this topic in the literature, very few papers have discussed it in the context of academic institutions which has one of the most significant impacts in terms of energy consumption. To address the issue, this paper places the topic of energy conservation in the context of academic institutions. Moreover, it adopts the Theory of Planned Behavior to investigate the success of energy conservation initiatives in academic institutions by looking at user behavior and its antecedents. Finally, this paper contributes significantly to the literature as it is one of the very few papers and arguably the first to discuss energy conservation in the context of academic institutions using the Theory of Planned Behavior.

       "   'Abstract': 'Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection (DENV serotypes 1-4) that imposes a serious health and economic burden in tropical and sub-tropical countries around the world. Increasing atmospheric temperature had changed the dynamics of the mosquito habitats and thereby influences distribution of these mosquito vectors. We examined the increase in the number of countries within the regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas reporting laboratory confirmed dengue cases caused by DENV-1 as a response to increasing global surface temperature difference. Data on the number of countries with confirmed reports of dengue (Messina et al. 2014) and surface temperature difference (General Circulation Model) were subjected to scatter plots and linear regression. There were 113 recorded countries across three regions (America=44, comprising the North and South; Africa=28; and Asia=41) reporting dengue incidence from 1943 to 2013, of which 98 countries (America=41; Africa=20; and Asia=37 with the inclusion of Australia) reported confirmed dengue cases caused by DENV-1. Findings suggest that the effect of temperature to the expansion of dengue varies dramatically in certain groups of country. Here, we explore three patterns (PAT) of expansion response where 1) continuous increase in temperature results into a continuous increase in the number of countries with dengue cases (PAT-A), 2) initial increase in temperature results into increase in the number of countries with dengue cases but subsequent increase in temperature results in the decline of dengue expansion (PAT-B), and 3) initial increase in temperature results into higher rate of dengue expansion but continued increase slows it down (PAT-C). PAT-A represented the majority of these countries, including 10 out of 11 countries in Southeast Asia. These results are in congruence with the past studies that supports dengue expansion to be temperature-dependent.'},\n",

Tautho, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1604.01.07, abstract: This study is a validation of the varied parameters of global competitiveness level of the ASEAN countries. Government effectiveness (GE) and corruption control (CC) are the direct predictors and independent variables while global competitiveness (GC) is the response variable. The determined causal factors affected by government effectiveness and corruption control are human development (HD) and enabling trade facilitation (ETF) which have varied impacts to global competitiveness. The researcher utilized a path analysis where 6 path models were established from the predictors (x) to its response variable (y) to determine which among these factors creates a huge impact. Path coefficients were generated and the summation of value effects was determined. Findings revealed that government effectiveness and corruption control were substantial elements that influenced the dynamism and vitality of global competitiveness landscape. However, GE has a strong direct effect to GC as compared to CC and from amongst the indirect effects, the correlation between GE and HD relative to GC has the highest path coefficient. The existing economic and political conditions of the individual ASEAN member countries reflected by the implications of the raw data collected are seen as an impediment to a more collective performance.

Government effectiveness (GE) and corruption control (CC) are the direct predictors and independent variables while global competitiveness (GC) is the response variable. The determined causal factors affected by government effectiveness and corruption control are human development (HD) and enabling trade facilitation (ETF) which have varied impacts to global competitiveness. The researcher utilized a path analysis where 6 path models were established from the predictors (x) to its response variable (y) to determine which among these factors creates a huge impact. Path coefficients were generated and the summation of value effects was determined. Findings revealed that government effectiveness and corruption control were substantial elements that influenced the dynamism and vitality of global competitiveness landscape. However, GE has a strong direct effect to GC as compared to CC and from amongst the indirect effects, the correlation between GE and HD relative to GC has the highest path coefficient. The existing economic and political conditions of the individual ASEAN member countries reflected by the implications of the raw data collected are seen as an impediment to a more collective performance.

It utilized multiple factors that can be useful for policy and investment decisions and are intended to complement analyses using financial poverty indicators. Using exploratory data analysis, several indicators were selected to represent the different dimensions of poverty.

Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia ranked 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in all three indices, respectively. In addition, multivariate cluster analysis was also performed. It revealed that Singapore exhibited exceptional performance in all indices, thereby earning it a cluster all to its own.

The study concluded that a wide gap exists among ASEAN countries in terms of the various deprivations measured. It also identified several problem areas and strengths of the ASEAN member states. This information can be helpful in making sound judgments especially in the delicate circumstances that surround economic integration.'},\n",

This study dwells at the factors that lead to sovereign bankruptcy among ASEAN countries in terms of business confidence, credit management, resource availability and market stability. To measure the indicators in determining the nations in the verge of being bankrupt, the researchers use the data depicting the corruption perception index, GDP and investment climate index. Furthermore, data regarding the ease of doing business rankings, credit ratings, surplus/deficit of the government budget, external debt, current account balance and inflation rate are also considered.

Velez Jr., doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.08, abstract: According to Clayton Christensenâ€™s Disruptive Innovation Theory, upstarts eat up\\nmarket share often with innovative and more affordable products and soon become the new market leader. Christensen sees its relevance in many aspects of human endeavor including in education. Cheaper online education is said to be disruptive of colleges offering expensive classroom-based modes of instruction. This concern was highlighted in a forum held in Russia and attended by education leaders around the globe. Other scholars, however, dispute this. For them, it is the interruptions to the totalizing attempt of most scholarships and not the impact of technological innovations that is disrupting education.

Regalado, doi: https://doi.org/10.32871/rmrj1503.01.14, abstract: The contrasting practices of private and public institutions affect individuals motivation to work on the maintenance of its facilities. This paper attempts to develop a model that could predict how many years a facility (private or government) would last based on the given number of assumptions and random data. The study used an experimental design using simulation modeling. Assumptions were formulated to measure different variables. Findings revealed that government facilities tend to deteriorate faster compared to its private counterparts. Government facilities would only last approximately up to six (6) years then reach its critical level. This is due to the assumption that only 40% of government institutions are effective workers. Low percentage of effective workers would translate to less motivation of the worker to pursue any transaction that could possibly help the current state of the facility. On the other hand, more than half of the Private facilities would last more than five years before reaching a critical level. This is due to the assumption that private workers are 20% higher compared to government workers in terms of percentage of effective workers. A highly motivated worker will always be willing to spend time, even extra time, to perform his job. Benign neglect of a less motivated workforce would result to non performance of his assigned task. Therefore, increasing the level of motivation of an employee is the primordial concern of every organization whether private or public because an increase of well motivated and effective workforce would encourage everyone to help maintain and to extend the life of every facility., published date: 2015-06-30, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/26,',\n",

Experts agreed that E-SelfIMo met the DepEd standards for non-printed learning materials, and students attested their high validity in content, format, and usefulness. Pretest and posttest results for the effectiveness of E-SelfIMo revealed that students exposed to the E-SelfIMo have progressed from “Near Mastery” to “Near Full Mastery” in the chosen Earth Science topics, showing more significant improvement in their conceptual understanding than the control group. This study concludes that E-SelfIMo supports interactive, active, and self-directed learning thereby, improving students’ motivation, engagement, interest, and per-formance.

Further, it was found out that the level of success of MDR-TB treatments among ASEAN countries varies inversely with the number of patients undergoing the treatment while directly proportional to the amount of investments in health expenditures.

       "   'Abstract': 'The Philippines has been inundated with socio-politico issues that impede peopleâ€™s desire for the countryâ€™s uninterrupted progress. These issues may be complex but their antidote is contrarily simple. An answer is found in Immanuel Kantâ€™s thought on moral culture which pertains to three essential features, namely: obedience, truthfulness, and sociableness. This qualitative research focuses on the fundamental ideas in the section on moral culture in Kantâ€™s On Education. As my contribution to the fund of knowledge, I proceed by establishing the implications and antitheses of the three features of Kantâ€™s moral culture. A discussion on obedience differentiates its two kinds: absolute and voluntary. Absolute obedience is the result of compulsion by a command, while voluntary obedience is the result of confidence by a reasonable will. It is impossible to think of character formation without also thinking of truthfulness. Kant asserts that a man who tells lies has no character. Sociableness emphasizes on the importance of building relationships and friendships. The researcher contends that these three features of moral culture have corresponding antitheses: violation of laws of the land for obedience; lying and dishonesty (highest form is corruption in politics) for truthfulness; and human rights violation (highest form is war) for sociableness. Finally, these features are imperative in forging peace and social order which usher to a kind of development that people aspire.'},\n",

With the use of a survey questionnaire, the demographic and academic profile and church involvement of students were first established and subsequently associated with their self-ascribed Catholic identity using Chi-square test.

Results in BSLA revealed an LC50 value of 7.05 Î¼g/ml (pâ‰¤0.05) which is considerably medium-toxic based on standard toxicity criterion.

Results suggest strong toxicity against earthworms at 75â€“100 mg/ml while having a moderate to weak toxicity at 25â€“50mg/ml.

Awareness, attitudes, and practices were significantly related to age and educational level, except for sex which showed no correlation with attitude and practices. Generally, this paper validates how knowledge influences attitude that subsequently determines behavior particularly in solid waste management as intervened by appropriate environmental education., published date: 2017-12-31, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/312, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 5 No. 2'),\n",

In each test, a dial indicator is installed and the maximum deflection is manually recorded. Based on the results, the maximum deflection values recorded by the proposed application obtained an average error of 18.38 % when compared to the manual measured results. This indicates that computer vision-based application can provide a beam-wide scale deflection performance, compared to the traditional point-based deflection reading. This study paves a new possibility of aiding manual measurements of concrete beams and all other structural studies., published date: 2021-05-28, link: https://rmrj.usjr.edu.ph/rmrj/index.php/RMRJ/article/view/895, journal name: Recoletos Multidisciplinary Research Journal Vol. 9 No. 1'),\n",
